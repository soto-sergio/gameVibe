Not worth the money. i would pay no more then 12 dollars for this game in its current state
Worthless piece of crap game, cant even play 5 minutes of zombies without it saying i have disconnected when im clearly online :/, might just be me tho.
i would say to get this game, but all it does is crash when i just try to open the game, if you plan on getting it, wait till they fix this, cause its ruined rust for me
nope
Best Local-coop game I've ever played.
Really fun game!Really good to play with friends(if you have any)JK
Brilliant little game that satisfies the "Animal Crossing" itch a lot of players seem to have. Packed with charm and things to do, not to mention that it's being actively developed and has free DLC. If you're a fan of games like Animal Crossing, I definitely recommend this.
Big .... up. Hard to understand and since it's pretty stupidly difficult at times with easy difficulty bots, i just gave up WAY TOO EARLY to bother learning it.I'd suggest Starcraft, Age of Empires or Warcraft, but NOT this.
Effective at being a .... when it tells you not to be one. Guess it doesn't want you to steal its job.
Love this game has a good online commity get for an fps
I feel like I should be ashamed of loving this game, but it is hilarious. A lot of meta humor and tongue-in-check fun poking at a lot of gaming tropes, wrapped around a pretty decent game.
Best Game in the world
This is probably by far the best game i ever played, it has all of the good elements of a survival game and unlike other games it has completely randomly generated weapons, and enemies! This keeps the interest going for much longer then you would expect, and with it's multiplayer feature it is realy fun and enjoyable to pla with friends. This game get's a 15 out of 10! and i strongly recomend this game to anyone at all that want's a good experience that will stay with them for a very long time! (moding the game could ruin the experience of your playthrough. I know this because a very good friend of mine warned me about his mistake of adding item spawning mods into the game.)
Great game but a jump mechanic would be very useful in certain cituations and so would melee weapons.
doesn't work
It's great 8/8
AMAZING!!
I just love it when every server I play has 500 ping. Don't you?
trash
Its very funny and fun and it made me laugh alot idk how but it also made me rage []IGNORE[]
i dont recommend this game to anyone it sucks BIG TIME IF YOU ARE A NOOB AND HAVE NO LIFE U SHOULD GET THIS GAME
Simply Doesn't work, GFWL will stop you from saving or playing online, seriously. WHY! Playing offline makes a semblence of sence, but not saving. What does microsoft achive from this? Stopping all from playing without going through the game in one sitting (a suicide mission) or using illeagle cracks. They apparantly fixed this problem but still, everytime I load it commands me to install and log into GFWL no problem if it acctualy ... worked. Don't resk it, get in console or pirate it, just don't ... buy it.
it is awesome try it
yup, it is a good game. One terrible thing is there is no control option to change button to play it easy, i played the free version on my old computer.
this game used to be good but the dev's ruined it by removing tiers, then the tech tree and now tiered blocks!! this game WAS a great game but now it is THISthis games community is also 3 year old ....
This game is amazing.It is such a unique idea and concept which was executed perfectly.I remember playing the beta a few years ago and wondering how something which seemed so boring and mundane could be interesting, and it was nothing short of interesting. The best passport and documentation simulator I have ever played.I highly recommend Papers, Please to anyone, no matter what specific genre of games you are into.Nice try Jorji, MR_PERSISTENT.Glory To Arstotzka.
this is a brilliant game, when more updates come out and people get to do more in the game it will be alot better
Great game, fun to play, simple yet complex. Casual yet very competitive would definitely recommend to all
TF2 was my favourite game until the Meet Your Match update. I started playing Overwatch but TF2 was still my favourite. But Valve rushed to beat Overwatch and added a heap of similar things to TF2 that could be seen in Overwatch. This game is now crap. Valve is trying so hard to fix the game. I can tell you how to fix it in one sentence. Get rid of Meet Your Match. Don't install until the fix the game. They should pay. Those greedy bakas at Valve.
very goodbest game ive ever played in my lifelife changing experiance omg so good
Spiderman, Rambo, and Michael Bay.20/10
This game has been in the same state it was 8-9  months ago. It had potential, but the developers just took the money and ran away. Now all we're left with is a ......, half-finished game that has potential, but will never live up to its full. Oh, and the nightly updates are just another way Chucklefish is trying to convince us it is working on this game, even though it seems to be moving at a snail's pace.
Best Game Ever.
it used to be good till the laucher BUG occurs..... it just said launching then PLOFF! gone.... this game just will not launch for me anyhow....
Honestly this is like an even .....ier version of clash of clans. I can kinda get why a city simulator with wait times would be popular on a mobile device but why on pc. This isnt like a portable iphone its a pc so therefor this genre doesnt work on this platform. And if u havnt guessed already this is pay to win as ..... I can understand paid items in csgo or league but in a game like this it isnt just cosmetic change that doesnt impact skill its straight up cheating.who wants to wait 5 hours for u to build up a new building in a city all to have it destroyed or downgraded by a kid using his mums credit card like a sword. Additionally half of the accounts on this game are inactive so trying to build up a group or a "clan" is difficult because most of the people you invite wont respond. All in all dont buy this game its a waste of time.
This game doesn't have a tutorial so It kinda renders it unplayableAlso, theres no objective presented to you
This is great (but incredibly hard) game.  It will take you ages to get use to and you will get very frustrated but stick with it.
Best game ever but small loan of a million dollars = butterfly knife case hardened
$6.29 for one new heist and a few weapons? No thanks. This game still has bugs that need fixing, an infamy mechanic that needs more work, and more attention to tweaking gameplay mechanics. Do yourself and consumers as a whole a favor, and wait until it's atleast 75% off steam. This is just an attempt to cash in.
It's a great game to play when you have friends or family around because of the 5 player hotseat that is avaliable. Unlike Civ 5, the turns are quite fast which doesn't  mean you have to wait 5 minutes each turn. It's also fun when you have a 3 man army up against a 20 man army and the 3 are winning and everybody around is shouting. Great game even if your playing against ai.
great game with lots of depth if you can get past the steep learning curve
I wanted to kill my self after playing this....

O.O my life
This game used to be fun and all.Then they removed the first person death camera.Then they made the game more eeehhh instead of WOOAH.At least bring the first person death camera back as an option, it was best thing!Now let's all go and get buried in other people's reviews of this game!
Counter Strike, a game made far long ago and escalating so much into quite the achievement. As much as I wish to appraise this game, it cannot deserve a recommendation by me, the fact that you are so unforgivingly banned from matchmaking is pointless to say the least. I was disconnected due to internet hiccups for exactly 3 minutes and 24 seconds (Yes I timed it) and it gives me a 7 day ban. The thing that makes this so frustrating is that, it was the first match back after ANOTHER 7 day ban for similar issues. The fact that they do not forgive the fact that you may live in a woodland area where power can go out every now and again, or the fact that Steam can act buggy sometimes gets it a 3/10 from this CS veteran.2/15/15 Edit: I recieved yet another ban from matchmaking, this times issue was the following; I kicked too many teammates. Let me begin by reiterating that I had just finally gotten back after 2 weeks of no playtime due to internet issues and in this first game, a teammate began to throw the match, I.E. shooting teammates, or shooting in the air around enemies. Yes, someone (Not me) called a vote to kick him and I agreed because he's throwing the match, but appearantly in 2 weeks of no matchmaking play, one vote to kick got me ANOTHER 7 day ban. This is a continued portrayal to CS:GO's broken economy and has dropped my rating to 0/10, how can a game be rated greatly when it prevents all access to competetive players even when there's a fallacy involved?3/13/15 Edit: Another ban to add to this list; this time it's from being kicked too many times, giving me another 7 day, and here's how it happened. The game was a Comp. Office; the CT was whooping our asses so far, yet with me being second top on our team, three of the players who were in a team decided to kick me, because they cannot win. This further proves my thesis that CS:GO is still broken majorly when it comes to matchmaking bans; the utter fact that this game has the audasity (Phonics FTW) to allow things like this to keep happening with no way of appealing to anyone about getting it lifted.
Nice Game Forever !!
literally the worst .... i have ever played
Just... Don't. No, please!
Would be good if it wasn't .... But I still play it
I got this in a humble bundle, and so i decided to try it, and i am like wtf is this. the only positive thing to this is all the wird landscape and wierd animals. my favourite part is how your eyes sloly close as you hold escape, but thats about it. Its a good game if you like constantly looking at brightly iluminated landscape artwork that moves, but otherwise don't buy it.
The core concept is neat but it is so broken it took me over an hour to get a game with my friend and another 2 hours disconnecting and reconnecting... The game was just posted on steam and then never improved.
No
Although Short it was fun Portal 2 was fun 2 Portal is one of the best games ive ever played
> Playing with friend> Go to pick up ammo, game crashes.> Verify files> 273 files failed to validate> Begins updating 14.7 GB11/10 would self delete game mid game again
:( :( :( :(
Funnest game ever. You will not regret downloading! Well...Maybe the trolls will make you regret it.... But thats only if you select a server that has one in at the time! Definetly a MUST PLAY from me.
Borats Seal of Approval - GREAT SUCCESS!Actually such an entertaining game even if you dont like FPS this game is just a great passtime and the weaponry and gameplay is unique absoloutely love it!!
DRM Prevents activation. Don't buy.
Mal otimizado.
Very harsh to new players. Combat system is strange but is still sort of playable in a way...Fighting against players who have way more experience against someone with low hours is really the worst.
I really love this game, the competitive gameplay mixed with a funny edge makes this game great! Try it!
Riddled with hackers. They're literally in every second game. If they made a single player in this as well however, it'd be pretty ... awesome.
Its AMAZINGGGG!
First time setup takes too long to load. if you are immortal or simply have a few years to waste then i do recommend this game. customization in this game is amazing, but gameplay is simply horrible.
Fun and unique, I wish more people played it so that it's faster to get into a match!
One of the best games ever created, literally endless possibilities
I haven't played a point & click game in years, so I was a little hesitant when I jumped into Gemini Rue. I was worried I wouldn't maintain interest enough to complete it. At the end of my second playthrough, I am pleased to say that my experience was the exact opposite.The gameplay is fluid and easy to pick up, challenging at times but never frustrating. The artwork is perfect for the setting with a noir feel that helped draw me into the storyline and continue engaging to find out what would happen next. A must play game for point & click fans, and I recommend giving it a try if you are new to them or returning to the genre.
beat frag game ever
Loadout is the the evil midget twin of TF2. Not really worth it
Well, I don't have much to say about the game. The North American shut down, leaving only European servers. As an Australian, I rarely, if ever, get a stable connection to Europe. i.e, I can't play the game at all. I can't even launch it.EDIT: I managed to get into the game. It looks okay, loading time is a little long for what the game looks like. But that's okay. I managed to get into a match, even with enough people in the queue I think they were all AI's, they had first/last names. Maybe the playerbase is just weird. The big problem was aforementioned connection issues. I couldn't do anything, Moving was constant rubber banding between where I started and where I was trying to move to.Don't get me wrong, it looks like a decent game. I'd play this. But I can't recommend it with such atrocious servers, and not even having servers for everyone else. If there were North American servers, i'd recommend this game.
Excellent Multiplayer
It's a really good thinking game at some points but overall awesome
The amount of hours I've played on it makes me look like a joke (which I am). The games that good that everyone who has owned the game for a year or two has over 100 hours on it. This game is really that good. If there is doubt in your mind as to if you should buy Gmod, get rid of it now! It only costs $9.99 and when there is sales it costs like $3!Just stop reading my review and buy it already!
kerbal space program is a friggen awesome game and everyone should have it
Pretty much dead multiplayer. The campaign is fun the first time around but the achievement system is broken.
Great game. I got it on special so it's definately worth it for the price that I payed.
Cant launch the game anymore :(OS: WIndows 10 64bit
Banished is a fantastic game. Incredible graphics, Awesome soundtrack and quite challenging gameplay. There is nothing more satisfying than seeing a city that has grown by your hand come to life. I have had no problems getting the game started, despite what others report. 10/10
it sucks.
This game is UNREAL. So much fun playing it and its only Pre-Alpha. The physics in the game are so realistic, I've been waiting for a racing game to produce that forever! Not to mention the graphic detail they put into the destruction of the cars! Overall this game is a 10/10 in my books. The future looks extremely promising and i'm sure the game will only get better!! Short Form - Well worth the money, you will not be disappointed.
one of the greatest free to plays out there 10/10 would give a cookie to
Lovely MusicGreat artworkGood ConecptGREAT GAMEEnough Said
CSGO IS THE MOST REALISTIC GAME EVER 10 out of 10 WOULD REINSTALL AGAIN HIISSSSSS
This Game is actually pretty decent, but fun to play, but now you cant play multiplayer anymore, because the servers had been shut down. But it is a still good playable game. I recommend you buy it since it has cool minigames.
#bestgameoftheyear2013
bloody horrible, is literally a game made in Unity and the graphics are either crappy cheaply made 3D visuals or google images.... I'm not kidding..............Don't play this game what so ever! It is pure crap
Great game, lots of fun. Best current FPS game for sure.
THis game is good , u should play it
This game reminds me of Texas
hi there can someone help me please um i bought this game and tryed to play it . only allows campyne to work but when i choose mulitpplayer it lauches the game but never open all i see is a black screen can some one help me
Running Linux? This game ain't gonna load.
200 hours and nearly $100 in DLC and I'm left with a bitter taste in my mouth of what once was. The introduction of microtransactions brought, among many other things, the downfall of a great game. The community has devolved, promises were broken. Shame on your Overkill. Shame. On. You.
As I write this review I have only played 1.2 hours.  This will no doubt go up very quickly.  I first played this game on console.  Ps3.  And that is where I fell in love with the series. But on the PC is where my love will become obsessive. The kind of I would die for you stuff that you don't want to get involved with.This game might not be the newest on the block but it sure is pretty on PC.  But I am a console owner too so I guess it doesn't take much to impress me.The story line itself.  The weaker one of the trilogy but still amazing in its own way.  May not have the jaw dropping reveal of 1 but still hooks me in everytime.  Plus I love those friggin Splicers.So far no crashes.  On Windows 10.  But I do have Games Live installed.  I would highly reccomend this.
Just get it! Simple!
The sims 3 is a very enjoyable game... WIth the DLC... I mean the core game is fun for the first couple of hours or even the first couple of days but it dries out quickly.There isn't enough to do in the core game and if you want all the DLC you are going to need to pay approximately $400, I recommend getting the game right now during the flash sale or just when the game is on special so you can enjoy the game a little more.Game elements like playing the Piano and going to university should realy be in the core game but no, you are going to have to pay for the "Late Night" DLC if you want a piano, or the "University Life" DLC if you want your sim to go streaking. With the DLC the game is exceptional but it costs far too much money to play the game without getting bored.If you bought all the DLC for $400... You could have bought 50 if not more games for that value, cheap-ish ones of course but there are many impressive indie games out there, especially now that the summer sales are going round so you can get over 100 games and still have some change.But as we all know EA are notorious for DLC so asking for less DLC that is cheaper would be asking too much so only buy this game if you have seen gameplay of the core game and seem interested enough or if you want to play for DLC.
Tis a good game...nuff said
team fortress 2 rocks []=====[]============>
Great game.This is worth buying.
This isn't what I didn't pay for
With all the expansions, CIV V is most likely the best entry level 4X game you could ever play. If you haven't played a 4X game before, this is most definitely worth a try.
An entertaining game with a nice sense of humour. :D
This game is amazing you have got to buy it. I know what your thinking oh 30 bucks then on sale for 5 dollars, probably a crappy game but on sale or not it's worth your money. Now if you hate portal 2? Don't go die in a hole. Go die in an endless loop portal. (portal on roof and one staight below it)

...... boring game
This game is the best!!!!!!Thanks Gaben!
I've really enjoyed this game, the grinding for XP gets tedious after level 86 but its fun! I wish we had more DLC's though, like characters from Dragonball Super 
Almost impossible to play solo, and even with friends you still have to grind for 30 or 40 hours to get the levels you need to build the items so you dont get insta-killed by the clans of 10+ people....
If i start the game im stuck in a boat and i cant do anything please fix it!!!
every time i launch it it says UE4 has stopped working
I tried. I tried liking this game. I really did. I knew it was CoD or Battlefield, I knew it worked differently. But when that differnece seems to change match to match, I just can't. The grind and Climb shouldn't be that steep so soon.Imma give it one more go, maybe in a week or two, I'm burnt out of it for now. One last go to have fun, or it's gonna stop taking up space on my computer. 
+1 Great game and lots of fun.
To hard to get resoursces Youll find thiings the die straight away a definate NO BUY!
Yes, game good, much fun
10/10 Music
Is a great game. For a free game is amazing even though to get the full experience you have to buy the DLC's. One bug is the going downhill and jumping you get the landing sound but really buggy. Overall fantastic game.
5fps....
Meh, Passes the time
I got this game almost a year back, it used to be amazing and used to have potential, but now its bloody P2W
AWESOME GAME
Was well worth my time. Very non-linear story line packed with plot twists and choices.
As much controversy has surrounded the Developer. A game should not be judged by the acts of it's developer right?! In this case no. The controversy that surrounded Phil fish and his remarks had not proven the fact that Fez was a terrible game due to Phil's attitude. In fact Fez was an amazing game and had it's share of fame.While this game. A great concept and idea executed by one of the worst and rude person who makes a game on the topic of depression which strives to be a fictional game based on a person living with depression.The Developer never had experience living with depression, leading the game to be highly unrealistic and mainly based on ideas on "what might a depressed person think?"The developer itself, sets a very bad example as a developer of a game which strives to convey the awareness of Depression.The game itself revolves around long text based story telling and can easily be picked out and written by anyone and not by the perspective of a person living with depression.For explaination of the controversy surrouding the dev: http://imgur.com/a/4VOcxTldr: Game is bad, Dev is an .......
Best Game
It's a realy fantastic game with a wide variety of content. not only that it looks good, but it plays good.But i do have to critisize it a bit so yeh. the controls are are bit too sensitive and the AI is a bit dumb.But over all for a free game its probobaly the best of it's kind out there
So, I am reviewing mods this whole week. Ive reviewed Estranged and No More Room In Hell yet and Half Life:Before. Now onto Synergy. You can play Synergy if  you have a game using the Source engine. So thats HL, CS etc. It is a Co-op FPS in well-designed levels. The shooting is great. However the main problem is replayability. After a round of having fun, I got bored with the same mechanics.If you want to have fun in this game, play it with friends using voice chat. Otherwise its a5/10Average
Great game, would recommend to anyone that loves board games!
YFirst time playing this gameJoins serverAll I heard was allahu Akbar10/10 Best terrorist sim
In its current state, I can't recommend this game. I can play BF4 at ULTRA getting 50-60 FPS, but this game is unplayable with everything on low. Yes, I am impacted by the AMD glitches, and yes, I updated to beta drivers, it doesnt work. I can't even get past the first level because of how laggy it is. I dont care about NVIDIA waveworks, and hairworks, and gameworks, whatever. The game should work just as well on all systems, and its like Avalanche completely forgot AMD existed. The "Quality Assurance" manager is a bit of a joke considering how unplayable this game is. Do not buy it until it is fixed.
it`s a terible 3rd person shooter where you rent or can only use for a certain amount of time and the maps are tiny
great game wud recomoend for all to get
When Krap goes digital it looks like this.
Good i love the easter eggs
I am very disapointed with the fact I could not play this game. I was getting 1 frame every 4 to 6 seconds and It was unplayable. I have a 4 year old mac potato and this is the only game iv found that it cant run. But the game looks cool please fix or tell me what i can do to fix this. I like the game I just cant play it
Payday is a grind of a game. Before the wolf pack DLC the heists were beatable. But now they just crank up the level and make it so hard it becomes unplayable. Payday 2 is FAR better but I wish they would make it more about stealing money and not shooting wildly at cops. Maybe someday there will be a perfect heist game,
Why is this in my games list?
I can not reccomend this games simply because I just don't like anything about it
Unfortunatly this game is starting to feel pay to win :(
love this game
Basiclly you get the money you win the game
the only good thing about this game is the uninstall button 0.1/10
2.9 hours of WAITING FOR THE GAME TO CREATE A SQUAD!!!!! Ive contacted ubisoft support and NOTHING. does anyone know how to get around the creating squad problem, i cant even get to THE MAIN FRICKEN MENU because it doesnt even get to load to there.
This game is dumb the ranking system is just ...stupid plz change it so u can see how close you are to the next rank plz i beg u. other wise is good 
No hats :^}
Awesome 3D Shark game
I may be the worst CS:GO Player but i still come back for more10/10
dont ... buy RAGE it doesnt work on PC. i swear you will get 2 frames per second no matter how good computer you got coz the game is coded so bad.
Lazy developers trying to make ez money by adding cases. The meta of the game is still there though.The whole idea of cases is stupid in my opinion.
Its Alright.
Very fun game loads of modding and custom maps to be played.
This game sucks ♥♥♥ there is no killstreak system like on Call Of Duty Ghosts. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Fun thats all i have to say
As fun as this game Looks,Its all a Big Microtransaction festIt requires you to buy money or spend Hours,And Hours Breaking blocks to get atleast 10 Coins. Or you can take the Paying approach and Spend Tons of money on this gameThis game is not Right for steam, If i choose 1 Option and screw up,BAM!,The game broke!,You Dun goofed!,You can't see the Entire screen!This is more of a Phone game (If it is,I don't care). It doesn't need steamThis is my opinon by the way, So don't be hatin
Three things: dollar for dollar the best game I've played in a long time. Minute for minute also the best. And basically those things aside - cheap and short - it was still a great game. MOAR FOR THE LOVE OF GOD GIVE US MOAR
The best total war game as of yet, almost everything is perfect about this game. I do wish that the AI would stop razing every city they pass.(whilst im dealing with internal and local issues and expanding my empire, everywhere else is completely destroyed. Every city razed with only a few stragglers roaming looking for more, then there is no mighty empire for me to fight)
Do you feel like being .......tted too..i dont.dont get this game it has its highs e.t.c if u like ww2 games than thats it down:buggy,death every 20 seconds from tanks,planes,p2w players cost alot for .... ass weapons,germany always ... wins and if u do get this game you will find out the other thousand thing .... as well.
Ah UBISOFT you give me a migrane....Hello Steam Comment scroller STOP HERE FOR A PROPER REVIEW!!!So here's the problem... HOW THE HELL CAN YOU RELEASE A GAME IN THIS STATE (Its BETA at BEST)PROS:-Awesome Ideas and concepts-Games are super fun and tactile-Graphics are great (there even a Super HD Texture Pack DLC on Steam for this)-Little to no hackersCONS:-About as optimised as Watch Dogs (I'm not Kidding its bad)-I don't see the point in release an Ultra Res texture pack (DLC) when high end graphics cards can barely run a smooth 60 on ultra 1080p-I can play on low to achieve 60 Frames per second (My System Build will be in Build Section)-Their are some really funky physics in this game (Up for you to decide whether you like this or not)-The Price to Context Ratio is Rediculious Get This on a sale not at full price unless UBISOFT GET their optimisations out SOON. I f you bought this at full price you are literally paying for 6 siege maps at best, A TUTORIAL and literal Search and Destroy game mode against bots that it-THERE IS NO SLI OR CROSSFIRE SUPPORT !!!!-AMD USERS PAY ATTENTION HERE !!! THE SUPPORT FOR OUR GRAPHICS CARDS is Abosuletly rubbish like Ubisoft thought noone uses AMD anymore-servers.... SERVERS.... SERVER!!!! UBISOFT DO SOMETHING (Before I break my wall with my fist)-Operators a great Idea but WE NEED MORE WEAPONS IN VANILLA NOT DLC-More Weapon customisation-More Operators that aren't DLC or Better yet let us make our own (just saying I'd pay for that DLC)-Driver support for this game are done as well as the list here of Pros to Cons (Absolutes RUBBISH)-Constant Crashing in Multiplayer-Build Section Start-+MY BUILD+CPU - I7 4770K INTELMOBO - Gigabyte Z97X Gaming GT RAM - 16 gb 1600mhz DDR3GPU - Gigabyte r9 390 8gb GDDR5 HD - 2 TB Seagate Barracuda 7200 RPMPSU - Corsair 850 watts PSU GOLDLEMME KNOW WHY I AM GETTING SUCH LOW FRAME RATES !!!!Driver software: Radeon Crimson 15.301.1201Honestly I get 60 Frame if I'm lucky on LOW SETTING SOMEONE HELP ME FIX MY FRAMES ISSUE-END OF BUILD SECTION--Final Verdict-Not Worth you money in current state, It is a great concept but its exicution is something of a disaster, With current Optimisations and game play content I am afraid I will have to give this game a dissapointing review score of3/10- Avoid Buying in this state and watch this review as I will update when things improve or get worse
10/10 would pass the whiskey again
bad
hate it
A different take on the FPS universe. It features diverse gameplay and intense engagements. A great alternative to Call of Duty, Battlefield, ARMA, etc. Buy this game either on it's own or in the Garry's Mod bundle
One of my all time favorite games I used to play this years ago and when I saw it on steam I HAD to get it amazing chaotic strategic fun If you loved worms or OpenLieroX as a kid this is the game for you.
This game is good and this review is pointless.
i am unable to get this Game to run on a I5-2500  with 8 gig of ddr3 ram and a gtx 650TI Graphics card  Game will load  to when Lara is hanging from a rope over a pit at the start and you are requested to swing  at this point Windows 8.1  will freeze  .i have tried to contact Nivida and Microsoft to no avail i have also tried to contact steam help but again to no avail . if you look up Tomb Raider on the internet you will see that i am not the only one stuck with this Lemon of a game.
I have better things to do than sit around for more than 30 minutes just to find nothing....
The game is really good its just that they need to work on with the multiplayer aspect, right the moment the feel of the game is clash of clans!
is glichy as hell with out an xbox controller it was so bad i even uninstalled
bought the game for 9c sold the trading cards for 20 trading card farming sim
The stories of fallout are amazing there is tons of lore to the game this game just kicks all of that lore into this huge expansive game it has different DLC's wich cover alot of the lore of fallout like Old World Blues,Old World Blues seems like my favorite expansion i never got to expirience it but the lore around big mountain is so good this game has a great story it has great personality and great graphics i think the graphics are better than new vegas by a little scrape on a wall though.So overalll:Story=10/10Graphics=8/10DLC story=10/10Expansion=10/10
Meh. Just a bit typical.
Really good shooter, however the lack of oceanic support makes the game nearly unplayable in the competitive modes forcing you to play the co-op mode giving you a half hearted experience.

Planetside 2 is something to play with friends. Fight as brothers or die as a hero, there is something for everyone and always a role to fill. It's free to play so grab afew buddies and drop into the action as a solo squad or join a large battalion for some chaotic action.
Should be refundable for all. Do not waste your money on this game
THis game is awful, do not buy it. go and buy a fattiest burger and eat it, it would do better things to your health than this game will...
This is one of my favourite games by far at this point in time, and I very much doubt that much will change my mind any time soon.  Why wouldn't you want to create space colonies, space stations, refuelling stations, rovers, planes, space planes and etc.  The mod support is fantastic. Most mods seem to be compatible with most versions. I have never had a mod clash with this game personally, and that's all due to the mods all being installed into the one folder. This prevents clashes and makes it easier for anyone wanting to install mods.I t may not be for everyone, but I do recommend it.
TRACK MANIA NATIONS FOREVERRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!
GREAT GAME thosse who liked borderlands 2 will like this one for its better gun models and good humorplus multiplayer is  BLAST
AWESOME
World of Warcraft + Dragon Nest + Ragnarok = Aura Kingdom :3It's Cool, :3 Play and Have fun
love this
Great game scott I love the Storyline of the 4 games however i only played the first one :( i wish i can play more but its way too scary BTW great jumpscares
Ish good game :thumbsup:
The graphics are really good, but the gameplay and the fighing style, i dont like also there is no options to change grahics setting, like resolution and you have to play on small screen.
Trove was fun... Until the Fire Nation updated the game.
This game is amazing. I can not believe the devs chose to make this a free to play, I would easily pay $10-$15+ on it. It's a mix between dayz and minecraft but so much more! Easily 10/10!
08/12/15 Patch broke the game and it seems Valve doesn't listen to the community or any of the pros feedback. GG Volvo.EDIT: Volvo fixed. I was wrong. <3
Please be aware! Your free game time begins when you create your account, NOT WHEN YOU START PLAYING THE GAME, LIKE NORMAL GAMES!!!!!! I did not know this and so lost my money as far as i'm concerned. Not even gonna bother. All I did was update the game through the launcher. Thanks for nothing Square Enix
Piece of ....
Dont get me wrong the game is good.... but I can't play in any servers.I keep getting kicked, and unfortunately there isn't a singleplayer option.No Australian Servers...
get this game play Terran Republic and then you win

Mods, Mods everywhere
Wouldnt Really Recommend This Free To Play, It Restricts Character Customization And Limits What THe Player Can Do
Well first. This isnt a reccomendation its THE OPPOSITE. Areas are blocked off from the world by invisible walls which in a i guess game genre like this is a bad thing since exploration should reward with loot like a diablo type game but this one completely says .... you if u try to think oh hey im gonna explore here. The animations are horrible and the level up system is boring with the oh hey put a few attribute points into this skill and even if i did eventually get spells from skills with the horrible combat it woudlnt matter (acording to a friend this game was also designed for an Ipad im not sure if this is true but what do u expect and at this point i really dont want anything to do with...THIS)
TrackMania makes it's way to consoles, expanding it's borders and supposedly bringing many new players to the game. But it seems that Nadeo has forgotten about it's PC players. There isn't basic stuff like control remapping and proper graphics settings. There also aren't customisable skins or dedicated servers. The new art style is cool but after playing a little while I've noticed tracks that are IDENTICAL to previous games.Really disappointing.
It’s an amazing game. The campaign is brilliants as well as the Co-Op, tones of brain-bender puzzles. And you can’t forget the hilarious characters. 5 minutes in and… Boom!! …you will love it. And defiantly get it when it’s on sale
I opened the game and pressed tutorial missions and they won't load beacuse the were created in a new version of the game even though I just downloaded it. It runs really badly on my computer with a 970, 16gb ram, 3.5ghz i5 procceser and the graphics look terrrible.
Still has a long way to go.
Was told this is better than NMS. It's not.
-10/10 would .... on again
Microtransactions
As i wasnt even able to get into a match due to the incomprehensible menus and redicolous lobby system for matches, my review is only based on the short time i could tolerate this mess of a game.Dont wate your time even downloading this game, its extremley out dated and there are far better free to play games that do everything this game tries to do but better, the text is microscopic, the resolution dosent seem to change at all when you can even find the options menu and there dosent seem to be a quit option anywhere.This game might be ok if it was a Mobile game but not as anything else.
Just realized the EULA is ... up as hell. It's basically Data Theft. I regret getting this game. If you want your data stolen then buy this game! Uninstalling... at least I only got this game for a dollar.
Seemed like a good game at first, except for the fact that it does not run too smoothly, it is not my conputer's fault, but the game itself is designed to the point that it is a bit glitchy and seems like it's going at about 21 fps. Also motion sickness as many others have mentioned is another major thing. Playing it even for 10 - 20 minutes makes you feel sick or dizzy.
Great Game, Amazing heists and a lot of fun. It could have a way to see when a person is typing or who is talking but still an amazing game overall
So I played this game out of morbid curiosity. .... it, why not, right? Everything said about it is right: the story is nothing, the music is godawful, the art is so limited and dull that you're nearly falling asleep. There's one whole choice 80% of the way through which affects nothing. Every single girl is practically humping the protagonist's leg (because they either love creepy strangers with no personality or he is literally the only male their age they've ever met).But what gets me is the ... judo tournament.Right at the start, protag is like HEY I'M TAKAHIRO, I'M NERVOUS ABOUT THIS BIG JUDO TOURNAMENT. If he gets it, bam, scholarship, he can start competing on an international level and make his career. He goes to pray at this shrine for luck in the tournament, and then time travel .... happens and we're in the past/alternate dimension/who cares.The whole time, he's going "I have to get back for my judo tournament! Everything's riding on this tournament! I've gotta go home and fight in my judo tournament!" Further shenanigans happen and the same demon-girl who transported you there initially is likeOKAY BROPORTAL'S OPEN BUT ONLY FOR TWO MINUTESIDK WHY, NO TIME TO SAY GOODBYEIT'LL INCREASE THE DRAMA IF YOU DON'T SAY GOODBYE NOW SHUT UP AND GOSo he goes back home and handily wins the judo tournament. A rising star in the field, he gains some level of fame and earns a scholarship to the school he wants. Everything he came back for, right? It'd be totally stupid if he were to, say, immediately throw away everything he came back for and go to the shrine and yell for two months, trying to go back to the other world.Oh waaaaaait.Why the .... did you even go back if you were going to invalidate the only reason you had to go back, Takahiro? You showed up, did the thing, and your yell of THE TOURNAMENT immediately turns to GOTTA RETURN TO THE PAST-FUTURE!!The rest of this game was some seriously amateur nonsense. That massive inconsistency on the main character's only motivation, though...that one really got me.Just watch the Game Grumps playthrough instead.
this is just amazing GREAT GRAPHICS and Awesome gameplay
Amazing game, the ending will depress you.
Game is promising but will die very very soon, devs don't care at all about playerbase and don't seem to want to implement an acceptable anticheat. Easy anticheat is garbage.
Awesome game! It's like L4D2 and Killing Floor, but much more realistic! This game REALLY needs hardcore teamwork, to win Objective Mode and Survival Mode, but other than that, it's really fun and "Horrific!"
have fun
Simplified Geometry Wars, could use a few tweaks (eg. a pause button) but definitely more than worth $1.00
I've barely played 3 hours and just finished the first couple of missions where you've gotta go after Vor or whatever. I killed him, and now can completely see this game is grind heavy. If I wanted to grind through a game, I'd go for a game with at least some open world features and maybe a tad bit of story like oh I dunno, WoW. This game is just murder porn with half a story and a grind that's completely unaddictive. This game could be more, but really it's the same crap with no variation.
Hasn't this game done well. Very well indeed.
Yeah skins NO
Between the cringeworthy dialogue, poor voice acting, unintuitive UI, and lacklustre gameplay, I can recommend this product, but not as a game - as an example. This is no Descent: Freespace, Wing Commander, or Strike Suit Zero.
SHOCKING, WOULD NOT BUY
*BEFORE YOU CONTINUE*I've been in Games Dev for a while now, so everything in this review comes from an industry-grade perspective. I'll try to be as objective as I can, so you can decide for yourself whether or not it's worth it.If a classic top-down RPG is your goal, by all means, get this. It has all you need to get started - the default build even comes with a main AND pause menu!So, let's play pros and cons:Pros:- Simple to navigate UI- A LOT of pre made stuff to make prototyping quickly- Documentation for the programmers- Reasonable price (when I bought it)- People make stuff for this game in Workshop- Some cool stuff in the workshopCons:- It's easy to tell when someone has made a game with this program- Most of the community made graphics conform to the grid of RPG Maker - making most of the stuff look 'generic'- Want to make a turn-based strategy? Best you find something else.- learnerFirendly = preMadeCode ? No : Yes (programmers will understand this); - Documentation isn't as in-depth as some of the meatier engines out there- People make stuff for this game in Workshop- Pre-made events make it easier, but what if you wanted to make a game in a different engine?TL;DRGood for top-down RPGs, not so much for other games - but not impossible
This game is the best game I've ever played! I play dota(warcraft) when I was young. Never getting bored because of update and fun gameplay. This game should be the game of the year 201310/10
This gameis so fun to play with a group of friends
The pacing with this game is all off.Most of it is slow and tedious, others are suddenly fast and annoying.The humour in it felt forced too.
Great game, Worth the money!This game is awesome and allows you to actualy work together with your team. There are a few PvP game modes along with and number of co-op one's aswell. This game would be an easy 9/10 and i would say to anyone who is into this genre of games or has come from Arma and looking for something more close quarters to get this game.
I dont know why i didn't recommend this sooner. Probably one of my favorite games on steam ever. If any of my friends don't have Garry's Mod, Get it while its cheap, totally worth the money.
Lacks Realism...Bad Game
Very Annoying. Made a very cool base in a cave. locked the front door with a lock and key. Ventured out to find loot. I fell and died. Fair enough. So I respawn back at my base, cause I thought I could create another key for my door, but I obviously couldn't so I couldn't get out. So I suicided by typing kill in the console. Spawned close outside of my base and ran to where I died and my loot was gone, including my key. So I couldn't get in or out of my base and everything I did was a waste of time. I'll have to bust my front door open which can take me a while and because I can't leave my base I can't go to get resources if one of my items break. *sigh*
Better late than never? This is a very old mod for Half-Life 1 which has now been released on Steam. I don't know why they bothered because it has not got Steam workshop and is very old now. The game defaults to a 4:3 640x480 resolution and you must manually change the video setting to Widescreen mode and then select your desired resolution. The game freezes on map load for about 30 seconds before you can play, if you click the mouse during this time it will crash to desktop.The maps autodownload on connection in traditional Half-Life fashion but it seems the developers have removed the rate limit of 2.5KB/s for server transfers as they download quite quickly now. Once the map has downloaded you will notice all of the textures are missing and you are running around a black and pink checkerboard map. Once again, no Steam workshop so you must manually hunt out the map and download it off the internet then extract it to your game folder and pray that the server hasn't changed maps by the time you go through this troublesome proceedure.The maps are seemingly designed for singleplayer as on a 6 player server it gets really messy with tons of people getting stuck in doorways/hallways as they are too narrow and you can't walk through other players. For whatever reason the players are actually objects that block you and make it a major pain to navigate the maps.Missing basic functionality such as changing your FOV from the options menu. You must go into console and write in default_fov ## to set your fov. The game doesn't save this settings between launches so you must manually go into your game folder and edit your autoexec.cfg in notepad just to change your FOV.This game is definitely showing its age and the developers don't seem to update it anymore as it missing a ton of basic features for a modern game. I have no idea why they finally decided to put it on Steam since it is far past it's prime.Would I recommend this game in 2001? Yes. Would I recommend this game in 2016? No. They should stop messing around and get sven co-op 2 out on the source engine.
good luck trying to get you old account to work even if you bought the game, the steam cd key is usless welldone ubisoft
IT IS A TRAILER WHY WONT IT WORK FOR ME
Its a horrible game and i really dont get the point to it. my advice dont get it unless you want to be stupid
Disclaimer: I have been told that there is a way around the bug which was the main reason for me disliking the game. Personally I have not given this a try, but if you are experiencing pathfinding issues play the game at normal speed.The game seemed interesting however whenever I sent my people to go and do anything I would have constant pathing issues. The people would run back and forth on the spot which meant that it took much longer for me to do anything as my people wouldn't respond. The worst case of this was in a battle, I tried getting them into towers however they just kept running back and forth instead of garrisoning the towers leading to me losing most of my defences. Until this bug is fixed it is a definite no go for me even for a dollar as it was unplayable.
i quite bad game
Pure win! Much easier than the first game, but still a blast to play through.
Nice
I played this game before it came out on steam, it crashed after logining in. Played it once I came out on steam, crashed after login. Tried look for a solution in the forums and other sources and no luck, the game loves crashing my computer
Game is great. Great graphics and great gameplay and very challenging however it gets boring after a few hours.
ummmm i have no idea what i should even do
.... game controls are bad dosent say how to control i cant move ....
hello this game have alot of lags/bags and is 2 years in beta i want it to be finly better game better ints and the door to be finly open or the key card make the door open7/10
HAHA THIS GAME SUCKS
Lacking the ability to actually watch dogs aside (or... if you're so inclined, move bags to a truck and then to a boat for Hector), this game is quite solid, even if somewhat overhyped. I've heard of people experiencing quite a few issues, but the one issue I did encounter... was that my game is set to windowed mode by default. So, every so often, right click aim to left click shoot somebody would... close the game. But once, I set it to full screen, this problem disappeared, and I found myself quite enjoying the game.Sure some there may be downsides, but what game doesn't have downsides? The driving isn't great, so I find myself preparing to run everywhere. I also quite like the ability to travel on trains... it's something different. This of course, leads to the CTOS. The connections within the city, and how things link up together are quite interesting, especially when you chain hack cameras to get to your objectives without even needing to fire a shot, or enter the area. Hacking is quite the new mechanic, and while there isn't really anything new to it once you've done it a few times, it is very interesting and fun. Especially if you end up roaming and hacking a random passerby... for obscenely large amounts of cash they should not possibly have. Or you blow up a power box. Or change the traffic lights. Or, of course, activate blockers while being chased...Even without playing through the campaign, it is possible to have a lot of fun just free roaming around the map, helping ordinary civilians through crime prevention or doing other things like privacy invasion... The city of Chicago is realized quite well, and looks very nice. It is also interesting to see the detail put into every individual you encounter, and some of their descriptions, or vices, maybe, can be quite... amusing. As can some of the phone conversations or text exchanges you can listen in on or read.And last but not least: the campaign itself. While Watch_Dogs does not have an expansive cast of characters, they all accomplish their job quite well and the storyline is quite solid and interesting.Is it worth $75 (or maybe more or less, depending on where you live)? Maybe not, but the game is enjoyable. Watch_Dogs might not be a must-have, but it is certainly fun.
Let's go Bowling
What ruined this game is where it was based in asia far cry 2 was much better set in africa loved how you could burn fields and realistic environment what is say is far cry 4 looks like it is set in asia as well
great game with a very well made feel and great balance.
A must-get game
DAY - 1 -I spawned in a cold area with very few dinos. Decided to chop some wood with my fists. First chop on the tree and I died. 10/10 would play again.
Fails to launch due to EAC problems. Support thread no help. 0/10. Broken game. Avoid.
The plot is pretty short and the developers have used the difficulty of game to make you invest more hours into the game so you can unravel the plot at a slower pace. Only get this if you find it in a bundle for a dollar with other games included.
The game does not work DO NOT BUY IT
a deaf and blind qudriplegic runs better than this filth of a game  (with recommended system specs .-.)
Intensly boring would not reccomend to anyone ever.
This is an amazing game. I'm not going to lie when I say there are some great times to be had here - running from wolves, trying to get home when bleeding out, shooting your first wolf; the list goes on. BUTThese game devs have been promising the release of the campaign or story mode for years now, each date being pushed further than the last. I've played 38 hours in this game so i feel i have some pretty good ground to say this:  a sandbox mode can only get you so far.  Maps and less bugs are all I see in each update and my heart sinks a little each time, because I really love this game and all that it can do, but i've grown bored of pointless survival. No doubt you should keep updated with this game and when the story will be released, but for now...If you want just survival, play The Long Dark.If you want just story, play Firewatch If you want both, play Kona 
BLOCKEIST GAME EVER
This game is totally worth buying. So much fun getting together with friends to play it with. Workshop is full of so many items, you can make it look however you want it. I'll never get tired of this game, :)
Amazing
Its weopons actually do damage. 10/10Get frequent 1 hit kills on hardcore with starting rifle.
Great game.Get a jobSpend all day trying not to crash.Car suddenly stops in front of you.50% damage.Limp to service.Repair truck.Do it all again.Build your own company. Be a millionaire. What's not to love.
Awesome game but it started to crash every ... time i try to join a server
Great game, amazing community, 10 / 10 graphics.Simply amazing
Absolutely great game. The physics of the game are hilarious, the building part of it can be heaps fun too, and when you finally get to your objective, in my case the Mun, you just sit back and smile :-)
Unplayable For Australians. You Teleport Everywhere And When You Do Get So Lucky To Get A Kill Good Luck Going Anywhere else with the camera zoomed in WAY to close. I Hate ThirdPersonShooters Anyway but COME ON. At least have the camera aat a distance so you can see what your shooting or see what your slashing. maybe the player is half way transparent while shooting. until then NOPE  NO BUY!
VERY NICE GAME MUST PLAY!
its so fun with friends but there is no singleplayer.
I would personally recommend this game because I can see the potental. There are many things that could be tweeted. I highly recommend this game and it's fun! Enjoy! :)
They want me to pay $60 for an expansion thats features should have ALREADY been in the base game that i payed $60 for
Not good for and users CPU OR GPU
DOESNT WORK !!!! Cant Sync for no appernt reason
This is the definition of either a michael bay movie or AMERICA!!!!
Game is nice n'all but there should be oficcial servers. I mean all admins are godded and pvping with spawned loot. Really annoying :/
A really good game, its stressing for me because i try to aim to be a pro. But its really fun to play with friends
This game is no thing but a waste of money and it's CRAP CRAP CRAP, when youre able to get into a world or realm or server which ever your prefer to call it, it lags like heck! it's so badly made that when you spawn youre somewhere unknown on a beaach how stupid is that.. naked and if you try to swim you drown.. yeah thanks for that.. i would not recomend this gmae to anyone at all.. i thought it be great but its nto evne finished.. good luck with htis crap game, all they are doing is gaining money by putting it up on sale when it will be free late ron when released.. sucks a$$ holes.. Just a note, REAL ALL THE BAD REVIEWS 1st so you can understand..
pretty fun alone, but this game comes alive with friends!
Incredible!
this game is the worst you create a charecter and then press connect and it doesnt work and iv tried reinstalling, and identifying all the files and it still doesnt work all i got to say to the creators is that FIX THE BUGS AND LEARN TO MAKE A PROPER GAME
SSSUUUUUUUUUUUUUUPPPPEEEEEEEEERRRRRR FFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUNNNNNNNNNN!!!!!!!!!!!!!
One of the best games ever made. The perfect combination of Stupidity and Creativity. I totally Recomend Garry's Mod.Enjoy
just no
Was kind of boring after a whilesame .... but idknot really worth 20 dollars
As a Total War fan, this game was disappointing. It contained a poor set of historical battles, a limited range of units and no story-based campaign. The game can be somewhat enhanced by purchasing the FOTS DLC, and in my view, was intentionally made feature poor to force customers to buy the rest of the game to find any great enjoyment.
This game is not the best for it's kind, the older ones I enjoyed a lot more. If your willing to try this I would suggest not to and just go straight on the next game.
Mcloving this game, just recently took over a castle and then got it taken away from me and lost all my companions. Now I'm going to come back with a vengence and 
Epic! BUT REALLY HARD...and raggy...and bugged
good game
Lol i love this game, TONS!!!!! of gamemodes and it just feels like their is always something to do. Trouble in terrorist town is the best!!!
Ark is Epic!I know normally I’m supposed to write a long and detailed review, but I am pressed for time and a shot and to the point review is what you will get.Ark is fun at first, and with the new content being added daily it refreshes the gameplay and allows the player to explore something new. However I found the endless farming and feeding tedious and repetitive. This is however offset by new content.Understanding that the game is still in early access is important, there are allot of bugs and glitches that spoil the game. However they are quickly fixed and rarely does the same bug affect you more than once. Loading times for the game are terrible even on an SSD, this issues is what put me off the game the most having to preload my game 30 mins before I play is not fun.The game itself is fun and exciting, you have a totally open world where you must survive and live. The dinos are realistic and creative; they offer a great amount of enjoyment to this game! You level up as you play to unlock new items to build and endlessly farm to gain the materials needed to build new items.All in all the game is fun and enjoyable if you can overlook all the current issues it has, I have put well over 300 hours  into it and after about that amount of time it became repetitive and mundane, endlessly harvesting food and materials.If you are into survival games that require farming and RPG mechanics all rolled into one then this is your game!
The guys at Bandai are just screwing with people, this game should be removed until an updated version is released equally to it's console counter-parts. Those ****s 
one of the best ever
When Final Fantasy VII finally came to Steam I nearly died yo.This game is one of the greatest games of all time. I first played this game on the PlayStation (when I was only young) I played it several times and again when it was released on PSN and now finally on Steam.Final Fantasy VII follows protagonist Cloud Strife a mercenary for hire who joins an eco-terrorist organisation AVALANCHE to stop Shinra from draining the life of the planet for use as a source of energy.Upon its release it was an immediate critical success.As with previous FF games it consists of three areas: A world map, field maps and a battle screen. What makes this game truly unique is the use of the turn-based battle system in which players command the characters in battles against CPU-controlled enemies. The skill system is based on Materia (magical orbs of condensed life energy) which are used for magic, summons and special abiliies.Good:-Hironobu Sakaguchi is a god-The story is simply amazing and it will literally take your breath away lol-Gameplay is amazing and winning battles against tough enemies is well rewarding (Emerald and Ruby Weapons)-The soundtrack is one the best ever composed in a video game, Nobou Uematsu the composer is a music god lol-The game truly redefined an era of RPGBad:-The Windows/Steam release uses PC MIDI files for its soundtrack which are terrible quality compared to the original on PlayStation, it is strongly recommneded to swap the files which you can do here: It deserves 10 foxes out of 10 foxes :D
*Changed review to negative. Overkill is an anti-consumer, pro-microtransactions company that spews out DLC like chips from a woodchipper. They have long abandoned all regard for the sense of honesty and the quality products they once had in their hands when they released Payday 1 - their practices today are the definition of good-gone-bad. Do not trust this company, and do not buy their products. Perhaps someday in the distant future they will be a reputable and honest company.
Whenever i try to play the game it says im ofline but im connected to the internet and online on steam >_<
mobile port, yo!
... phlog
This game is fun with an interesting and unique mechanic that is both fun and rewarding to learn.Often you will find yourself thinking outside of the box while playing each level to reach the exit.The storyline is engaging and entertaining and makes sense in the context of the game. It does not feel like it is forced in at all.You might be worried about replayability, but with the addition of the level creator, the community can now create and share their own levels very easily. This adds seemingly infinite amounts of replayability.If you enjoy puzzles, especially those involving spatial awareness and unique mechanics, you will enjoy Portal 2.
this game is very fun. i dont see the p2w right now. i am level 5.it is a lot like wot but i love the respawning. makes dying a lot less frustrating
The hardest thing about this DLC is overcoming the Bugs on the PC version. Don't Buy waste of $$
Pretty fun game, but there is a huge range of problems. Definitely not worth 60 USD at the moment. You probably want to wait until a lot of stuff gets added in + fixed first.
You are Bob.You are Brilliant.11/10x10
When you can actually get onto the game it is rather fun.
Clunky movement, lots of Russians and a terrible basis for the game make for an AWFUL time! I played for a quarter of an hour and just couldn't even deal with the lag. (Which by the way, is not due to my computer.) Save yourself some time, DO NOT download this.
So much lag -_-
........ game made it f2p because they are ready for it to die thats why you should never play a jagex game
its very nicely done, there are a few bugs but it is early access so they can be forgiven but other than that its a very enjoyable game
This game is SO realistic, you have to manually get your guy out of the tank, pick up the barrel and pour it into the tank, just to REFUEL it. yeeeeeah....
Love it can never get enough
Ark Survival Evolved is the result of Rust, Pokemon and Jurassic Park having a threesome.
Doesnt.Even.Open.11/10
This game is absolutley awesome. If, like me, you love the Ace Attorney games, you should buy this game. 
WORST GAM3
Boring storytelling that isn't spooky and with less gameplay than Faerie Solitaire.
SsO IF YOU ARE GOING TO GIVE ME A SWORD, ATLEAST LET ME KNOW HOW TO USE IT! and unity 101 put a damn exit button.  here ill do it for you   if (Input.GetKey("escape"))            Application.Quit(); You are welcome.
...., its TF2 and overwatch. and the verify is ....!
WOW! Just look at my hrs played, I didn't even know I have spent that much time on this game!!! Time well spent! If you have heard it's good that's because it is, If you've heard its bad it is only lacking improvement in those area's, this is an Early Access Game = not finished! If you find something the needs work TELL THE TEAM!!!! They are more than happy to include everyone's ideas. If your still not sold by recommendation from a friend just try it out during the many free to play weekends.
its fun how u can create anythingit is a lot more flexible than most games
Omni Ender: whats thisOmni Ender: dirty matt playing a cleaning game
Okay so before i start this very short review i would like to note that though i only have 3 hours in this game i have played roughly 200+ offline in the past, before it was on steam. Also note that i am comparing this to AOE2. Okay so let me start with the plus's of this game.+Better Graphics+Bigger mapsThats just about all i can think of for plus's.When it comes to the minus's i'd like to think i have a fair comparison when looking back to aoe2 and this game. So this games "RTS" system is probably the most unqiue and bull .... excuse for a game under the genre... The games AI is broken as ...., the level up system is ... stupid and dont even get me started about the varity of teams. A small thing that made AOE2 unique was the randomised team names where in AOE3 it uses actual historyical figures to play as, all of which are terribly voiced over. I can't stress enough that this game is a watered down yet stale game.I cant recommend this AOE game because it hardly even stands up as an AOE. PS: Yes AOE2 is one of my favorate games.
there are no australian servers.... 
has a fantastic loot system and plenty of challenging enemies. one of a kind
The title speaks for itself. This game is BAD. If you are gifted this, decline the offer immediately and ask the sender why they hate you.
great graphics, well...the new ones are, glad they updated thatgreat weaponsAND AMAZING FEATURES, although, more weapons would be cool
(When you enter the room with the two giant skeletons)"And this is my nope room. This is where I keep all my nope"
It's the worst saints row in the series, but there's fun to be had with it. There's like 3 references to the movie "shoot 'em up" which is awesome (so is the movie). But it doesn't have clever writing or anything like that (which was thanfully returned in the 4th game). It just has strippers and ...... (awesome.... Right?) Buy this on sale, you'll only get like 5 hours outa it, before you go and play a better game.
Pretty bad, didn't even play it for that long. Btw game is shutting down
meh i dont know how to play
Stop looking for bad reviews and buy it already!
P2W Microtransactions
its such a shame i used to play this on my old comp and loved it... but its just a broken game now.  not sure if steam should even be peddling it (as it doesnt function properly).  no wonder its free.
This game was incredible and one of my favourites before this Giraffe update came and ruined everything. I am not reccomending this game at this current stage because beign forced to use the matter manipulater every time you want to mine because pickaxes and drills last 5 seconds.Thats some b.s. Until you can mine better and faster without using a ridiculous "repair" system and be able to get your ship up and running without playing a world for 10 years to get 20 cores i will despise one of my favourites. Also what the hell is up with not being able to start a new character with a new world? i have started multiple characters since giraffe and am always! always on the exact same world i just tried to leave behind. Overall Bring back the Koala updates and this game is highly recommended!
One of the best RPG games that exists.10/10
this a broken game, the steam authentication is broken and the multiplayer crashes the game whenever I try to join the server. evan though I only payed $1 for this game, I feel that that dollar was throwen into the sea. the game is very unstable which can really .... me off sometimes!
Wasn't expecting a huge amount when I got this, but after starting it up and playing through the first song I instantly loved it. That 100% for every song is so alluring, and anyone who loves good music will love this. 9/10
ARK: Survival Evolved is a fun and beautiful game, I have played countless hours with friends and I have never been bored by it. There is soo much to do in this game, whether it be trying to tame a dinosaur you want or building a bridge to link the many forts and homes you will build. I have never experienced playing the game on the EPIC settings but I have seen a few YouTubers play at those setting and my oh my does the game look great! Now you may be wondering why I have not recommended the game, that is due to the many problems that ARK faces such as extreme memory leaks and subpar optimisation, the memory leaks are a big problem for me as the game seems to eat up my RAM and spit it back out at me, I have heard the devs are trying to fix this issue but all I see is more content being put into the game which is good but also making the memory problem worse on mine and my friend's PCs. On multiple forum posts and other friend's first hand experiences I have heard memory leaks of up to 23 GBs! Not very healthy for a computer if you ask me :P All in all ARK: Survival Evolved is a great game but it sure does need some tuning up and until some of the problems are fixed that are causing people like me and others to not be able to play the game properly, I cant recommend the game to anyone unless they have a HIGH-end computer, but if you really want to play this game I recommend that you atleast have 16 GBs of RAM available if you want to run the game with mods.EDIT: I also forgot to mention that ARK: Survival Evolved has some of the longest loading times I have ever seen, so if you are fortunate enough to have an SSD with some room on it then install ARK on there.
when my anti-virus program detects this as a virus worries me
This game is ruthlessly unforgiving, and equally as brilliant. It's beautiful, despite it's age, and a childhood classic of mine and anyone else who had a playstation when it's demo disc was floating around. This is gaming royalty; do yourself a favour and play it. The only PC game I can reccomend more highly is the sequel - I can't wait to see what Oddworld Inhabitants do with the New 'n Tasty reboot. 11/10. Would play again.
i dont recommend this game beacuse it ius to difficult to play with other players in Untyrned.
very good Game you should definetly buy it
boing boing boing
Very Fun simulation chalenging but still very fun!
it was a good good dlc , but i can't swich it to chinese , i can only use english. i hope your guys can fix it
Rockstar has provided us a sequel to a great game series, ultimately winning over many reviewers with its single-player story whilst having its multiplayer experience leaving an unsatisfying feeling due to its hyped bank heists which released about six months or more after the game had been released and the multiplayer servers and mechanics being downright broken.
Very fun game, good for wasting time and even getting competitive. Hours of fun and fustration ahead. Highly recommend this  game to anyone looking for fun and enjoyable gameplay.
Love dis game i cri every tim
All settings on low, crashes as soon as the world loads.
Over 1000 hoursToo Adicting
I bought this a couple of weeks back when it was on sale for about $20.I got really into it, taking Bristol City up into the Premier Division, then got head hunted by Newcastle but it wasn't long before I jumped their relegation bound ship to Leicester City.  Took them up to the top of the ladder, played in the Euro Cup, won the FA cup, had a few good seasons.Got a bit bored and pressed a few too many buttons of management and had an emergency meeting because I leaked some stuff to the press.  They asked me why they shouldn't fire me.  I responded - You won't find anyone better than me.  They disagreed and I was sacked!I had a few weeks holidays, only applying for top teams (Olympic Lyon, Valencia, Bayern) and finally landed the dream job of Manager of Real Madrid.Of course, the team were already performing well and so I made some slight tweaks and went on three months holiday.  Came back and saw they were still coming 4th, so went for another 3 month holiday.  Still 4th, but I was expected to win the LIGA so I played through the important games to make it happen.This game has a lot to it, but it can be slow and sucks up a ton of your time.  I got to the point of just going on holiday every match day so I could just quickly get a result.  I was in 2023 and everything just got boring so I resigned.Still tho, 162 hours (probably 30 of those spent AFK) for less than $20.  Good value.  But I do feel like I've wasted my life!  Hopefully I don't do something stupid like start a new career!
one of the best 4x space games out there in the market
was pretty good when it was first out, but the devs forget this version of the game for PS4.2/10 was pretty good, now pretty bad
What can I say? I sold my house for my skins.
this game. 10/10
plays with friend*finds chest*to share or not to share?not to share11/10
Simplemente, Perfecto.
DO NOT BUY THIS GAME FROM STEAM. If you do, you'll be at Steam's mercy, likely to waste a lot of money on an inactive game like I just did. This integration is the worst I have ever seen, and although you probably won't notice any problems at first, you will, eventually.
I can't believe that the Season Pass just didn't live up to my expectations. Out of the three DLC packs that come with this game, only the Far Harbor DLC campaign had a decent load of content, that's somewhat enjoyable to my perspective. However, that isn't going to stop me from recommending other people to avoid buying the Season Pass of Fallout 4.When you look back into the downloadable content that is seen from both Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas, they actually provided a hefty load of replayability and fun factor with the DLC campagins coming from both these games. It's definately no doubt that I've enjoyed a lot with Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas in terms of the standalone games and the downloadable content.At least for me, I was able to buy the Season Pass of Fallout 4 on its initial price of almost 30 US dollars before Bethesda Softworks suddenly increased the price to almost 50 US dollars for some reason which I don't get.But take it from me, if you are really going to purchase the downloadable content from Fallout 4, it is wise to think ahead first if it's really worth it to consider buying Fallout 4's DLC.
AI Simualtor 1984 I mean Banished is fun for the first hour or so.Then... the AI's capabilities start to come into play.No matter how well you plan your town eventually all of your Lobotomites will end up starving except for one person who lives by himself who decided it was a good idea to have all of the town's crops for himself. People starve in their homes, doing absolutely nothing about it while the family next to them have enough food for their entires lives. I honestly don't understand why the AI need to only take food from Stockpiles when there is litterally food everywhere as they wander around being unproductive and generally useless.Don't keep the town alert tab up, because you will get Death and starvation messages from a town with enough food for 4 other towns.3.5/10 Not enough water.
Your Dayz experience heavily relies on your computer's capabilities. An average computer means glitchier zombies, horrible graphics, the ability to run through objects and other annoyances that can ruin the realistic feel that Dayz is trying to provide. But, as for many games, the enjoyment you will have depends on your frame of mind and the amount of time you are willing to put towards it.Not recommended for those with an average pc, but if you're willing to stick by the game during its development, the majority of glitches will hopefully be fixed and the player with an average pc can still have a good time playing Dayz.As for the players with a good pc, it's a good, fun game. However, the current lack of items and things to do can make it very time consuming and monotoneus (yes, that's  what you would expect from a game in this genre, but its far more time consuming than it should be), but don't worry, your efforts will eventually pay off and give you a load of enjoyment and an almost real survival experience, with the occasional glitch. The updates are slow, but once the developers get on the right track and make their minds up (and get their priorities right) Dayz should steamroll into the game everyone wants it to be.
Awesome entertainment to kill sometime..!!!
dont get this gae the serves are down DONT GET IT!!! lost 7.50 on that.
9/11 rated by IGN
Couldn't play doubles in Tennis. Would not recommend....
awesome game but the only bad thing is its the same as tf2 but just re-skin of characters. so im putting it as a thumbs down. sorry for the people who like it.
the best game ive ever played, hands down
This game was horrible to look at when I booted it up....
played it for 10 minutes i'm like 0_0...... What the f**k is this game i have nothing else to say 0_o
No oceanic server. Shame, the game had huge potential
The game is interesting, I played around 18 hours its a great concept, upgrade your gear, your ship and explore infinite planets. But unfortanly I'm probally not going to recommend this game, reason being the game deleted my save file after 18 hours of gameplay, What a real disappointment. There was a fix around, but really come on hello games, what title out today has trouble saving your progress, and because of that I probally wont get back it to it. I had the momentum going for this game, but once it ..... in your face you cant go back.
This game is really good, it has a good story but the missions are a bit to hard.
Glad I bought it on sale.- Short - 7-8 hours- Repetitive predictable fighting.- Only 4-5 types of identical enemies.- Levelling system is weak+Pretty+Story is ok
dont download not worth it
Here's a quick review of the game:The controls are great, with them being tight and responsive. There's a wide variety of weapons and planes to choose from, with even more coming. The maps are perfectly sized and creative, and I would personally love to see even more. There's also a nice amount of gamemodes to choose from and I've found almost no bugs/glitches.The 2 main problems I see with this game are:-A little bit pricey for an early access game. I understand if you need a wider budget or something, but $10 just seems a little too much.-Nobody ever seems to be playing it. Seriously. The servers are always deadly quite. There is a subreddit dedicated to this game with regular developer updates and the server list makes it look like nobody plays anymore. I am honestly confused; where are all the players?But overall, Air Brawl is a good game with a bright future.(As a side note, something I would love to see in this game is music. It would be awesome to have the kind of music from the trailer playing while you're in the middle of an intense fight.)
I think i am a mediocre to decent player at racing games but when you can't even beat the first race against AI in career mode something is seriously wrong. Other than that the game just simply offers little content with tracks that could have been more interesting.
I cannot stress enough how much I hate some hitboxes in this game...
This game is just terrible, if you have $10, please spend it on something else.
Clem is a total baddass, she aint even fazed yo!
Bought GamePlayed for 5 minutesgot kicked for no reason10/10 would play again
Personally i think you should buy this rn
A children's game but if you have hours of fun secured good game give it a 8/10
good game need more work on it.
Excellent game highly addictive and the mods are fantastic, any RPG fans would love this game
so realistic, thats what i like. ill rate 10/10
An affectionate satire set in jolly old Britain.
"Towns is an amazing experience to have. It may seem tough and unforgiving when you first play it, but the more you play it and the more you learn, the more you will enjoy it! This game doesn't hold your hand the whole way through which isn't a bad thing. One bad thing about this game though is that the tutorials make absolutely no sense and doesn't really help at all. This game will make you manage a colony of people, while dealing with things like starvation and monsters. It is by no means an easy game, but if your up for a challange, then I really must recommend this game because, even though it is not perfect, it is still entertaining. I give it a 6/10." -Snubbo 2014Well, I see that my oppinions have greatly changed. This was the period when I was engrossed in this game. Let's just say that I no longer find any enjoyment out of this. This is a game with tutorials that are about as easy to understand and Astro Physics, the difficulty curve makes it really hard for newcomers and really annoying for anyone else. In this game you build a town, get people to move in, manage the food, water, ect. Eventually you may even get a warrior to move in. The problem is keeping your people alive, with the management system not quite working, which is a big problem in a game that is all about managing. Here is an example...You set some of you villagers to start picking apples, drop them off, and then cook them into pies. You then get the rest of your crew to go mining, with the help of some warriors. After about 20 seconds the warriors decide to wander off, 2 of the 5 you had get themselves killed, on the way to the apple and pear trees your villagers manage to drown themselves, the rest come up from mining to find no food and then die from starvation on the way to pick apples.The result is a game that doesn't want you to enjoy it too much. Final score? Get a better game/10
Very Extreme Fun Game In My Life do More Shotguns Plz I Love Shotgun! Mushroom LOVES SHOTGUN
I wish I could get my money back. This game is nothing like what it showed. This was very misleading.
glad i got this
binding of isac rebirth + more content = 11/10 game
Thus Game Is Awesome!!! And Free!
a "playable" game that descripes itself as a stealth game so shouldn't your be able to avoide the ...... combat instead of locking the player in to it ever time someone hears the little green .... farts. 4/10 a better buy would be dishonored or its dlc
Amazing game Great fun
PROS:+ Gameplay+ Graphics+ Ability to practice with botsCONS:- Short, cliche campaign- Lack of dedicated servers- Lots and lots of campers- Paid map packs- You almost always spawn next to an enemy- Lack of innovationDespite the cons, the game is not too bad but its not too good either.
This is without question one of the best zombie games i have ever played.  It's not just another simple zombie shooter. In a time when zombie games are littered everywhere, this game really stands out apart from the rest. It has a strong story line, top of the line parkour mechanics and the day/night change that almost makes it feel like your playing a different game.The engine they are using really brings out the realism in the environment. I never would have thought that i would get weak in the knees from fear of heights when playing a game on a PC, but this game sure does give you that feeling. I'm proud to be an owner of this top of the line AAA title!
i love this
Best game ive played in a long time.
best game ever!!!
Is good9/10
will never play it again
Great game, very addicting 9.5/10
Good game, but has one of the worst match making engines I have ever seen. Takes way to long to get into a game
unturned rip offworst game ive ever played...literally
Best Game Ever
nice
Good Good
Counter-Strike Global Offensive is an awesome multiplayer shooter that's easy to play and fun just about anywhere.ProsFun, multiple game modes mean you don't have to play the same gameCheap. Can be found for sub $10Not Demanding. My friend can play this on his cheap Ultrabook with some specks of lagSTEAM WORKSHOP! Some brilliant maps that stand out from the others.Cons{h1]Multiplayer is laggy at timesNot much to mention, really.
What can be said about primal fears? well it is an updated version of dead hoard, there just isn't really much change with this game there are only one or two variations of specimens that have a different size and skin texture but are still the same well let's go through the list.Pro's-More Weapons!-Hub World(Camp)-An Arena-Moveable PropsCon's-Moveable Props...(they can get in your way)-Not enough enemy variation-Enemies absorb way to many shots.-Limited sprint 3 seconds(can't roll)useless since most enemies can catch up to you anyway.-Always night.-Cannot shop in peace(shop menu doesn't pause the game also cannot buy medkits)-Re-used enemy jumper(which was in dead horde)-Level design is dull and cliche'd.-One level can take from 15 to 30 minutes to finish depending on difficulty.-Melee weapon is useless in any situation and serves as a joke when you could be spriting away for 3 seconds.Overall i would say this is an avarage shooter, no real innovating ideas or any new concepts, just reused boring ideas, if you are interested in shooters and just want some mind numbing fun, buy it, if you are looking for something new and interesting, don't buy it.if you want something similer try nation red or zombie shooter which will prove more fun.
... stupid .... u just die at the end
Best game
Thought this game was online co-op. It wasn't. Also I am in the progress of refunding this game and lm gonna get 50% of what I payed for. What.Goodbye $13.50 buckaroonies.
Day one DLC? bad NO thats something id expect from EAEnemy hitboxes stop working past 150m SERIOUS ISSUEMultiplayer is unplayable, compareable to watchdogs on launchdayCo-Op is also broken, second player that is connected to the host will fire 2-4 times for every single click of the mouse on their end.The AI is FAR from groundbreaking like the devs would like you to believe, unless ground breaking is spotting you and calling for help while being stabbed in the jugular and also seeing you at 100+ meters while you are prone and in a bushOnly improvements from SE2 is prettier looking graphics probably the only posative thing i can come up withDefinatly regret buying it, will update with more issues/praise as i progress into the game
If you leave 1 man behind on a ship he will cannon his teammates to bits. Treason at its finest. 11/10
It took me 11 minutes of gameplay to realise this is going to be good, it's like Hexen/Heretic/Quake/Doom but with nice graphics, modern controls and an okay storyline.
Haha nice
Its boring as .... .....
Love the game but always a pain to join in sick and tired of trying to login
really great story, characters, effects, backgrounds and choices that will judge your morality, totally deserves game of the year as its predecessor
Saints Row 4 is a recycled Saints Row 3, the art style is the same, it's got the same linear missions with a small twist so that you can use the super powers, and the super powers were the worst addition to the game. The art style is terrible, it's got the same low resolution textures and the "effects" are just the models of stuff morphing or the textures pixelising. This game has the worst missions, the missions seem fun at the start, but towards the end of the game, the missions are just the same thing repeated over and over again, and to get some good weapons, you need to do linear side missions which are not fun at all, I do not recommend you buy this game unless it is only $10 or less.
honest to god trash gameenjoy a .... esports online community for this game with idiots who think they know everything about this gamehltv is ok thoenjoy .... mechanics with a dev that has no idea what is good for a competitve scene for flourish and growthhahaha yes lets add weapons and balance changes that negatively impact the meta because we think we know whats best instead of the actual people who play this game for a living90% of the playerbase is mentally ........ as well and if you're probably one of them
A solid dlc, new campaign, multiple new factions with each having new medieval styled units. It gives a good total war medieval 3 vibe. Although the rosters are small, I would say its defenitely worth the price but if your tight on money wait till it goes on sale.
Talk about a memory leak.
Not what the trailer descibed it as
Annoying memory leaks, whichs causes long long lag spikes less than 1 fps which last for a few minutes at a time.
Pretty good game. Been playing for nearly 4 years straight... May need to get a life. The community is really good and interactive, and the forums a great. Really hooking game, and the best multiplayer game I've ever played
WAS a good game, then rip developers. Do not download you will not be able to play :(
This is the most buggiest, laggyiest peice of .... game i have ever played. The trailer shows you what you can do however infact you cant even do half the .... in that trailer. Being spawned in the middle of no where is not ... fun either. This game has been in Alpha for almost a ... year. A ... $5 cooking simulater would be better then this garbage. Should you buy this game?... .... NO!
Well what can I say about The Crew, An absolutly fantastic Online MMO Driving Sim that has be one of the best so far. Stuning Graphics, Huge Server Supporting Hundreds of Players interacting on one great map. Where they where taking ideas from Atari's TDU/TDU2 concept and other Drivering Sims and making the first true 21st Online Car Sim That truely beats GTAV or any other Real World Sim that has free form driving.The Driving Experience is just inspiring to invision the next installment of this Game. we cant wait if they create Europe Maps or Go Crazy and create a map of the whole world :).
This game has potential. A lot of potential... But it needs a lot of balancing before it gets there. Randomised dice rolls that you have to prioritise and manage make for a very interesting game and very fun. The character perks add a decent amount of customisation to the game as well. Story is engaging, and the visuals are pretty good for a relativley simple setup.However, the random 'encounters' if you will, realy need to be tweaked. Having 3 events that remove 2 health each and require 20+ points to address is an instant restart. Or else watch your crewmen die in 1, maybe 2 turns.This game is fun enough to play, just dont expect any real progression until it has been balanced a lot more.Also- cut scenes are not skipable with the mouse. Mildly annoying, but dealable.Good game to get on sale at the moment. Otherwise... eh.
This a brilliant game on its own. But what really sold it to me is the dayz mad that is available. If you are keen on playing with friends or even a solo journey get this and give the mod a try.
Just do not buy this game
THIS GAME IS PURPOSEFULLY MISPELT BRILLANT.I STILL HAVE CAPS TURNED ON DUE TO ME ACTIVATING THE SPECIAL ABILITY FOR EACH CHARACTER WITH THE CAPS BUTTON.
Too confuesing controls suck and just annoying
i'd forgotten how much i enjoyed this game! I had it originally on PS3 and picked it up recently on PC with the steam sale including all the DLC and i throughly enjoyed it. the motion captor work gone into the facial expression at that time was amazing and I am yet to find a modernised police/detective game I enjoy as much as i do with L.A Noire. giving the graphics a bit of leeway given the original DX9 that it launched wih i still find the game as enjoyable as when i played through the game in 2011. throughly recommend even in todays standards from a gameplay and story point of view.
This game is really unrealistic. The running sucks, the controls suck and it's unrealistic. Better off getting America's Army: Proving Grounds for free. There's no-one to play with on the servers.
DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!Ok - I didn't do any research on this... Just saw Deus Ex and assumed it would be new DLC like The Missing Link.Biggest mistake I've made in a long time. This game was made for for apple ipads and iphones using only touchscreen controls, then ported to pc...badly. I would have thought that the developers would have tweaked the controls and graphics for the modified crystal engine that Human Revolution used. Did they? No - they used the Unity engine that they used for iOS and seem to have paid absolutely no attention to converting touch controls for mouse and keyboard.As a result the game is virtually unplayable and Eidos has shafted many loyal fans for the sake of easy profits.P.S. For once, Twilight is a better love story than this game
Casually found a dog wearing armour so I went ahead and pet it, it's neck got longer so I did what any normal person would do, I spammed pet for about 5 minutes until the dogs neck went to space and came back down to earth again...Oh and this is also a great game, I highly recommend getting it
There's a lot lacking in this game but it's fun once you get the hang of it, my biggest issue is that it's repetetive and there's not a lot to aim for. Still give it a go though!
good game with pewds
i got ban for no reason i didnt use cheat but i got ban wtf with this game
Insult simulator.
Best Game !
The idea of the game has potential, The camera is terrible and goes all over the place. Very glitchy and needs some TLC all in all the COULD be a good game but isn't.
really fun survival game kinda of a minecraft style survival but with way better graphics and guns involved really fun and addicting i highly reccomend this game to anyone wanting to try out something new
me like this game i have almost 400 hours 10/10
for some reason it wont work
dont play kids
gr8 game m8 i rate 8/8
I have spent many of hours with the roller coaster Tycoon series and loved them all. but this one is the Pits.  Crap overall game play and I know its in it's early phase but its not fun,If you want a great game to play and I have spent hours on it allready, is PLANET COASTER.  WOW graphics are fantastic and buildings you can design and sculpt. hours and hours of enjoyment.
Semi successful story telling experiment that almost manages to reproduce a somewhat unpleasant experience. Too short and too uninteresting to really have any substance or impact, I cannot reccomend anyone pay for Dinner Date, for free you can sign up to Tinder or a dating site and experience a realistic sense of isolation and loneliness. I rate this game 1 Swipe Lefts out of 10.
I actually really like this game, it has a very unique charm and flair. from parodies of popular games and movies, to cheery kill everything insight you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, all in all it's a good game. (history not included.)
This game is deep and has a lot to learn but once you do its surprisingly addictive and really fun
Just Cause 3 could have been one of, if not, the funnest games  of 2015. However this game suffers form massive performance issues. Keep in mind I am running a Nvidia GT 750 TI, and I know this is not a great GPU but I did expect to run this game at high settings. The performance issues I have incountered in my roughly 4 hours include:~ Last time I booted up the game I experianced a loading time that took over 10 MINUTES to get into the actual game.~ At sometimes it would tank below 15 FRAMES making it unplayable.~Many audio issues.~Issues unpausing after leaving the game idle.~And while swimming I swam through the map causing me to drownThese are the problems that I have experianced but I've seen online that there are many, MANY more issues with this PC port. It is a shame as this game could have been one of my games of the year but instead like Arkham Knight the performance ruined my experiance. this pains me as a fan of the series, having completed both previouse Just Cause titles. I know it's not only Avalanche but for me it was the straw that broke the camels back this needs to stop in the gaming industry and is an unacceptable practice.
one of the best telltale games out, can not wait for the next episode
I tried to like it but I couldn't mainly because I dislike p2w games.
you get in and you feel really lost and i couldnt go anywhere plus the robots were way too dificult wait a bit longer and then buy
Its a good game but the excitment only lasts for untill you go bankrupt and the only way to progress is do everything you've aleady done. 3/5 Crumpets
This game doesn't work DO NOT BUY IT!!!!!
Its a Good Game Even It Is Still In Early Access.
Great game it is so addictive!
well,this is master peace,an't got no words for this...
when you find a game where the main steam picture is a 89/100 rateing from game focus (idk who they are) there is little hope and you get what u pay for
fantastic it's really fun and is still in beta so buy while its cheap
Really don't know what I'm doing in Rome 2 but with the help of a mate who does know what he's doing, Rome 2 has become highly enjoyable
Counter Strike Nexon: Zombies? >playsMake Sure You Uninstall This Game a Total Of 700 times Before Playing.
Waste of money, this game ... sucks .....
All i can say is PERFECT10/10
AWESOME
...... engine, frame drops in crowded areas, runs trash on a 970.
Best community. Very nice people and are always willing to help. Heaps of workshop items that make almost every table top game possible to play. Even played table top mini golf. Regular people who teach you how to play new games.
each time i go on it the screen turns grey:[
Call of Duty is one of the many games (FPS related) that I play, you cant exactly contrast the game with other FPS games are they have different play styles. Most of the time, Call of Duty is a fast paced shooter with quite a lot going on. Well thats what it seems like to me.The game is good, dont get me wrong, it is enjoyable to play BUT there are some issues that should be addressed and taken into consideration when you click that add to cart button.1- What the game has become.The days of being able to use other weapons in game is over, being able to reliable cover a section of the map with an LMG or Sniper is no longer a play style that can be used. there was nothing that I loved more than being able to mow down 3 guys trying to flank your spawn on DOM. instead the game has become saturated by 1 specific play style.2- Rush.I can understand that Call of Duty is a fast FPS game, one of the easiest to play in that matter, you dont have to worry about bulletdrop like Battlefield, you dont have to worry about listening for footsteps or other sniper shots, Sniper Ghost Warrior but there is a limit in which how easy you can make it. both Black ops 2, Ghost and AW (I dont own AW but from friends that have the game) are saturated with the use of SMGs and/or Shotguns, having small maps really makes the efficieny of using a Sniper almost obselete, LMG users are constantly being dominated by the fast firing high DMG smgs you find in BO3, yet when it comes to balancing things....3- How to guide: Balancing Weapons.after using the Haymaker 12 for quite sometime now there are a few things that I do not understand   -Somehow, it is the shotgun with the least amount of damage, yet, fires a buckshot, like most of the shotguns in BO3   -I am consistanly getting hate for using the weapon, note most of the people that are hating on me, get to close.You See, Treyarch fail to see that there is a difference between Balance and butthurt, Balance, is not nerfing the crap out of a weapons to turn it into a waterpistol, that is what you get when a whole bunch of people dont like being killed by the Haymaker, the simple counter measure to a shotgun is to not get so close to someone, simple as that. but when balancing weapons, also take into consideration where the complaints are coming from. This could be from places like reddit, youtube etc, once you read these comments, actually take some time to look at statistics, I am sure you have some spare time while monkeys are fixing the issues with the game to make things right. there is nothing more than seeing a game saturated and dominated by fast firing SMGs with have the range of a sniper... Im not just saying this because I get killed byt SMGs quite a lot, but more so that it is true. for example, if you look at say the Vesper, chuck rapid fire, laser sight and fast mag. You pretty much has a lightweight minigun.there are positives to the game, the zombies is spot on, I love it!, have enjoyed every single moment of it!, especially when you disconnect from Singleplayer....Multiplayer, although has a fair amount of issues, is fun.but my main complaint for the game, is the constant FPS spikes/stutters... any kind of help I look for either says update the drivers or get a better computer... I have updated the drivers, which had pretty much no effect what-so-ever, getting a better computer well, I think I have good enough specks to be honest (i7-2600, HD7950 and 8GB ram).Dont you find it sad how, supposedly, Creating a sequal to what was quite a good game (Black ops 2) take such a downfall, games are meant for enjoyment, being able to communicate with friends, and all the people that have apparently slept with your mother. Dont you feel dissapointed in YOUR inability to fix the mistakes and become a better overall game developer. Isnt it demoralising when you see that just under 50% of the comments/reviews on the game are Negative? I know this will most likely not been seen by the eyes of any Treyarch developer but all these questions run through my mind. the thing is... what goes through yours...
It's good! The graphics, moving foliage, lighting is great.Few complaints, however:1. Main campaign is a bit short. I feel like it could've been longer, I finished in 10 hrs of gameplay.2. Lara's face change. I mean, come on. TR 2013's face was so much better. I don't like the new round-face Lara one bit.3. Instead of $70, I would recommend to pay $40. For the short storyline, $70 is a bit steep.4. AMD's TressFX in TR 2013 is a lot better than HairWorks in this one. A lot more of a resource hog is HairWorks.5. The story, no matter how long it is, is a little cliched. We've seen it all before.6. The best parts of the game is post-campaign when you're trying to 100% it.Anyway, I recommend this game. I'm on my way to 100%ing it. Should be fun.- Matt
I just hate the game, its been in Alpha forever, I want my money Back!!!!!!
If you're a fan of repeating the same .... over and over again, this is your kind of game.
One of the best games I have ever played.However it is not for everyone, here's why.So Hyper Light Drifter follows a charecter called "The Drifter" or "The Magician", a blue skinned guy who has a kickass sword and can dash and kills stuff! The story for the most part is hard to follow if you dont pay attention and because there is no dialogue it isn't dropped in sort of easy to pick up hints.
on my alienware 17 it dose not let me play it
I realy like this game it has gotten me to undersatnd alot more about farming
I download Already! but. game wont start . What! What the .... what are u doing for this game?! 
I would like to start my analysis saying that, if you like Sci-Fi games, you will certainly love Starbound. Starbound has a incredible power of make you just want to explore the damn universe. You can choose between 6 races, and they are perfect well chosen by the creator. The game stills in BETA test, and it is awesome. I imagine that game in the end, without bugs and perfectly ended, as a classic of the new 2D games. But I think that they should improve the storyboard, such as creat some items. But in general, I recommend that game for everyone!
This game is the best World War 1 game I've ever played but at first my FPS was low on high settings but as the game updated they fixed the fps problem and now the game is amazing for me.
I would hate to see anyone waste $10 dollers on a bad game like this so heres 3 words i will give you about this games "absolutly freaking terrible"
The graphics looks pretty good. I like the setting of the game.
Disgrace to MMORPGS but nice animations
There's a very special place in hell reserved for games of this ilk. Rushed, buggy and poorly designed, I bought this with the Star Wars Humble Bundle and still feel like I didn't get my moneys worth (a whole $12, WHICH by the way came with 8 other fantastic Star Wars games) . I am embarrassed for whoever created this lazy piece of trash which is somehow shorter (4-5 hours), more repetitive and packed with far less features than the first Force Unleashed. I would rather sit on a tea crate and have chicken .... sprayed all over me than play this utter piece of .... again.
Damn good game.
SO MUCH GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORE
As a game I picked up for $4 during a sale that I've currently pulled 8 hours out of, I'd have to say that so far it's definitely worth it.  Combat is simple but fun and raiding in parties with friends or even just with other players is quality banter.  The grinding isn't too monotonous and the ability to choose crew/captain traits allows you to decide if you want to level up by trading, exploring or combat- or a mix of the three to keep things interesting.
Its a absolute perfect game, Very fun
At the release of Payday Overkill said that payday would never have microtransations and now almost all weapons need DLC and now there are cases that NEEDS you to but a key to unlock.Payday 2 is now only about making Overkill money and have not taken the communities ideas in forever. Don't bother getting Payday unless you have $20 for the game and ANOTHER $50 just for DLC then can play for the cases. And finally payday 2 is just a game for people who want to grind for a thousand hours and i can think of 10 better grinding games straight away. please don't bother unless your rich.
This is a great game, recommend for 12+
I'll keep this short:Incredibly fun, but very difficult to play on your own if you're not a veteran wizard.
BOOOORING
This game is not as cool as it looks. Get Starbound instead, this game is still early access and is a lot harder than starbound and terraria, I won't recomend this until it has improved, better world generating is needed and it is not r than terraria or starbound until it has improved, I really Regret buying this game. (wasted $20)
It was fun until they decided to triple dip, where if you want the full experience you need to pay over 80 extra dollars for DLC and your end game content is TF2 CSGO style crate gambling for random skins that give stat boosts :)
this game what can i say its the best game that i have ever played lately i have been so addicted and i love it even more because i won a 2% bet and got three knifes!! BUY THIS GAME
I've been playing Terraria for 3 years now and its been my top favourite ever since i bought it, so i do suggest to buy it some people might not like 2D platformers but you should try this, you won't regret it.
Its a pile of .....
I Recomennd you getting this mod When your just playing Half life 2 bored no one to play with but this mod you can play it was fun so i would get it if i was you
Good game
its a rip off... thats free
My review will be negative until they fix all of the game's crippling performance issues.FROM software said that if you could play Scholar, then you could play DS3 just fine. My FPS in Scholar was constantly 60, yet in DS3, it drops down to less than 10, depending on where I'm looking!DS3 even auto calibrated my settings to high, indicating that I SHOULD be able to run the game effectively at those settings, yet the game still suffers terribly. Even when all of the settings are changed to LOW, the performance doesn't change! This means that there are serious problems originating from the developers, and that they must be fixed before you consider purchasing this game.Stay clear for now.
the lies told in this game will haunt me till the day i shuffle out of this mortal coil
[EDIT] I have since solved this problem!!! I have windows 7, here's how to fix the problem (It's very easy). Simply hover your mouse over Trove on the taskbar and it should show you a 'preview' of what's meant to be on your screen now, simply right-click on the small slot and click 'maximise'. Then it will show up! I believe that it was just so tiny that I couldn't see it or press maximise. [EDIT]10/10 would get a game that shows you the intro screen.1. Started listening to the most amazing electro / dance mix ever.2 . Spent half an hour getting past Glyph's security measures (Although that was mostly my internet spazzing out).3. Was basically told that my password was awful.4. Finally signed up for Glyph and Trove.5. Installed Trove which was relatively quick.6. Opened the Glyph homepage for Trove.7. Noticed that you couldn't put it in fullscreen which didn't matter as it was the homepage.8. Was excited to finally play Trove.9. Opened Trove and pressed play but nothing happened. Sound was there and it said it was open but nothing except the homepage was on my screen.10. Finished listening to the most amazing electro / dance mix ever.Disappointed as it was an amazing looking game and had such good reviews, if anybody knows how to fix this could you please add me? :)
To call this game a game would be a misnomer, its essentially a tumblr blog with hyperlinks in which you are given a couple of different option all ending at the same points.
10/10 ign games too addicting.
Managed to get the purchase of this game refunded.  Doesn't run at today's resolutions and therefore looks pretty bad on-screen -- that's if you're lucky to even get it running in the current operating systems.
The game is just....bah.One of my major problems with this game is the fact that you walk sooooo slowly. They give you big forest but expect you to take 6 hours to get around. The headbob gives me a headache, and there is no option to reduce it or turn it off. What were they thinking.Who shakes that much when you are walking so slowly anyway?The game is pretty scary, but Slenderman doesn't really jump out at you much, he sort of just watches you. Well, that is only in the first couple of episodes, before I had to take a break and rest my eyes.Just, don't buy this game.
Awsome Game!
Really stupid and always crashes
just buy it
I know I haven't played this game for long as it says. But there is a reason for that. This game is almost unplayable for me, sure the campaign is alright, works but continuously glitches for me and bodies get stuck in weird positions, maybe that's just my computer but I have a high end laptop and had to set the game to the lowest settings. Multiplayer is a whole different thing, however still very disappointing. I played the co-op exo survival mode and died every within 2 rounds because the game would lag, I was in my own private server, lowest settings once again. This game uses up to 40% of my CPU and that is crazy, slowing my computer down a fair bit. Anyway, whenever I try to play online at any given time, it takes a while to find a game (because no one seems to be playing it either), and then once a game is found it will load and just before it goes into the level, the game crashes.0.1/10 would play again in a decade and then remember it was crap. Buy and play at your own risk. I would recommend getting the game on console instead, but apparently they are having similar issues with multiplayer.
Absolutely the best top down strategy game out there, the animations are super smooth and the equipment and weapons to use is so expansive its unbelievable. You can literally play this differently every time thanks to the mission generator so i'll be putting a lot more hours into this game. Definitely Indie game of the year 10/10.
This is a fun game
Simply..♥♥♥♥ing..Amazing..And..A..Pain..
So much fun!
very fun
DO NT BUY THIS GAME I UNFORTUNATELY WASTED 40 DOLLARS ON IT AND I CANT EVEN LOAD IT UP KEEP GETTING ERROR ON THE LUANCHER PEICE OF .... SONY WONT FIX IT HAPPENED FOR PLANETSIDE 2 AND THEY STILL CANT FIX IT .... YOU SONY AND .... THIS GAME
DONT GET THIS GAME UNLESS IT GOES F2P.The game says it has a fair business model, that its grinding experience is easier. Early on you get 250 coins per challenge but you soon realise that this is only temporary. You will realise that green decks stomp pub matches and their costs to play the cards are utter BS in comparison to the others. You pay 25$ for early access and then on top of that if you want all the cards in the current game you have to ay an extra 50$. Very Dissapointing, Don't get sucked in with this games trailer etc.
Massive loading times and unbelievable lag. Need to pay a large amount in microtransactions just to play regularly.
Great game 10/10 everyone has to love the Counter-Strike Series>better than C.O.D>Everyone loves to call you a hacker>Hardly no 12vies :D
This game takes effort but in the end u will be satisfied i mean i have a fear of the ocean but hell i love this game how the devs are determine to make this game fun. It takes a while to grind out stuff but the rewards are satisfying.
Ok so i thought id do abit of a review, 950+ hours - Been playing rust since legacy so ive seen this game grow to what it is today, Ive experienced all the new and old things in rust BUT this new XP system is just game breaking! It is basically a race to see who can farm the most, so for the people not in a big clan are at a massive disadvantage(shared XP), This also means you cant come into a wipe half way through anymore! it requires many hours if not days just to aqquire anything decent! I hope the devs are reading this! We want Rust back!!
it's take an hour time to join a server and it said connection timed out
This review will switch to positive if the performance situation changes. My setup is an FX-8320 overclocked to 4700Mhz, with practically the same performance as an Intel core i7-4790K. But the game insists in using just 2 modules (2 cores in case of an intel processor) of my 4 modules with 8 threads processor. This is not about the fanboy battle about “AMD sucks”, this is serious, even the new core i7-6700K ( 3 times more costly than my FX) can’t pull more than 45 FPS with a huge graphic card. Also I have a Radeon R9 290X (1040Mhz) that can run everything in ultra 1080p/1440p or medium 2160p. But here I can’t pull more than 45 fps in High settings. That’s not good optimization. People with similar setups (i7-4770/90K GTX 970/980) have the same problem, just 2 cores being used making FPS drops and stutter as a result. I can’t understand why high end graphics cards like the R9 290/X, 390/X, GTX 970, 980/ Ti can’t run the game in ultra at 60 FPS, logic says I should be able run this game in 1440p without problems. Also I have big FPS drops in my huge base in hidden lake, reaching low 30 to 25 FPS. I probably have to be thankfull to run the game in stable 35 FPS (capped with AMD Framerate target control to avoid jumping between 70 to 40 constantly) with nearly ultra settings, but not everyone has a high setup like mine.Edit 27 jun: update 243.9 "* Fixed significant performance issues with dual-core CPUs" It makes the game even more "dual core" optimized. I detected even less FPS (-20% CPU bound FPS from 30 FPS in my huge base to 26)DON'T BUY THIS GAME. Also we need the devs to take action in this issue ASAP, please don't downvote this because you love this game. I love this game as much as you, but 90% of the people can't run this game without editing INI files or having a beefy PC. The game is still lagging. You HAVE to work in optimization.
I bought this game on a whim because it was only $2.50 in a Steam sale. This is one of the best impulse purchases I have ever made, the game is extremely fast paced and rewards learning the levels. It is not unfair like some other 2D platformers that try to be hard for the sake of being hard, this game is very fun and satisfying to play. Controller is highly recommended. You go down a certain number of floors in the tower then fight a randomly selected boss for that level, by performing certain actions during gameplay you can unlock extra weapons & items which randomly drop as you kill enemies. I gifted this to another friend of mine and we both absolutely love it and played it nonstop for the next couple nights (there is no multiplayer though). The music is really cool and the art while basic is quite nice to look at while everything flies past in a blur :)I definitely recommend picking this up in a sale, you won't regret it.
Terrible
Mmmmph mmmph mmmph! Highly addictive, fun, 9 uniquely different classes to play as. Also hats and now the CONGA!
when i finish a game it stops working and i have to exit the game
hell fun to just hack and slash and blow up zombies to your hearts content.the only problem with it is the lag, you need a pretty decent computer to run this game properly.for that I give it around a 7/10 or maybe less
Very Nice, Easy to play, but hard to master game. 10/10 Would Recommend
Yes it is a Really fun game but it becomes pointless and then you have watsed 30 dollers on a game that you had only played a few hours on there need to be something more and that takes much longer
One of the best sniper games I have played up to date. I was not a fan intially but thanks to V2 I feel like getting V3.
best game ever
This is a great game to play with friends, you will find yourself playing that game over an hour as i have witness that because its a game in my opinion to get distracted and only concentrate on the game
This game is a great game and I will say that and not regret saying it, It is a class based game and I like all the classes and dont get me wrong we love the classes but it just needs maybe 1-2 more classes. Team Fortress 2 is a great FPS (I would say better then CoD!) and a funny, bloody and creative game. Now I would give this game a uncontroable 9/10 it those deserve a 10/10 but it needs 1-2 more classes, plus a Minimap (Just saying!).
this game used to be soo good but once it got bought out they turned this majestic game the had so much potential in to a peace of trash
10.50/10 ign ps: a friend gift me this then he died  
This game is a cool game because you have so many choices to pick and you don't have to listen to the narrator. Also the easter eggs in this game are awesome
BUY BUY BUY , this game its just everything a gamer could ever wwant in a game. and probably the one of the best Assassin creed's Games made! graphics 10/10,  story 10/10 , plus you can run around and assasinate people, who wouldnt wanna do that. the game encorperates a huge free world map that you can explore if you please,  your character can also climb the highest of buildings with no problem at all. parhour everysingle part of them game 10/10 game buy it !
dis gem is so gewd its to much to tek in.
thanks
why i loved the game in 10 points or less - seamless integration of cutscenes from activation points with no loss of it's beatiful graphics quality- something like 3 layers of attack type matchups for some involvement of strategy- incredibly beautiful environments and accompanying particle effects- flashy effects make for HYPEHYPEHYPE combos, of which there are tons to see- "loveable ragtag bunch of misfits" character trope, the interactions of which i enjoy seeing- the fighting mechanics are not too difficult to grasp and in fact, add an interesting level of complexity to gameplay- nothing like seeing POWPOWPOW numbers of damage and combos- OH GOD THE PUNS! 
Most rip off game of the year. Won't run.
Great game. So many maps and content. So much funAlso the mods for this game are awesome too
Excellent game, puts me in mind of some of the games i used to play as a boy. Still has some minor frustrations, but it does not make the game any less fun. Best part is the replay value - always something different. Lots of opportunity for expansions and hope for things to come!
v231.0. Way to .... on players.
TOO MANY ..... DLC DONT BUY SAVE UR MONEY TO BUY BETTER GAMES
Just a short review.Survarium is a post apocolyptic game were 2 teams battle on multiple mapsI dont really understand how these people think you cant find battles I have found them very easily6.5/10 -ign
Luigi's mansion is alot better with some actual ghosts
THIS IS A GOOD GAME WITH ROBOTS AND SHIPS!!!!
10/10 would jump off the roof again
Great game all about space Highly reccomend it
Gotta love some of that classic patriotic aussie racism/camaraderie.
Could of been a lot better then what it was. I got this at release and with all the .... that went on with it the giving of DLCS the taking away of DLCS the every update used to currupt your game file so you couldnt use it after update. Man massive let down donno how it is now though? If fixed most things would be awesome but after re starting the game 4 full times i say no no. 4/10
one word.....AWESOMENESS
It's not very good
Short, enjoyable and relatable. Dem feels ~
lol idk how to play still fun 10/10
a nice game but still gets boring
Lan PartiesOk So downloading this game it seemed frightening at first with the controls and gameplay style. But now after playing 10 mins of the game I’m already loving it. I see that this game has a massive future in gaming with lots of friends. One of the first games that I’ve seen which allow many users to play at the same time on the same screen. Also the fact that people can play on their phones, tablets also allow everyone to join in and participate in the game.
THIS GAME SUCKS. IVE BEEN KICKED OUT FOR LITERLY NO REASON, PEOPLE WILL KICK YOU OUT IF YOU KEEP GETTING HEDSHOTS WITH I DID COTINUSLY BUT I KEPT GETTING KICKED OUT. AND ALSO WHY DOES THE SERVER KEEP CLOSIN MY   CONNECTION? AM I OING SOMETHING WRONG? I ALSO SPOTTED A HACKER BUT I STILL GOT KICKED OUT, IT IS RECOMANNDED THAT YOU NEED TO BE A ACTUAL NOOB IN ORDER TO PLAY THIS GAME!!
Source is better

REALLYL HARD AASSSSSS GAMEMMEM
dont play this terrible game!
super bad game ever.i can't creat my id.
this is fun game to play with friends if i were you ill get it now (t't')
this game is incredible, worth the $50
Game has no sound, some of the gameplay and ALL of the humor relies on the sound.  Unless Jackbox games fixes this issue, I can not recommend this.  Shame too, YDKJ was one of my favourites when I was a kid.  If I could rate all of the, at once, I would probably downvote them all apart from volume 6 since it is the ONLY one to have sound for me.
This is the reason I am waking up in the morning and going to bed in the morning. "10/10 IGN. Like Skyrim but too much Crowbar."
I'm just doing this for my Pillar of Community badge...
Ok So i dont have the greatest computer but when i get attacked i died instantlyWhen i saved i didnt have my log cabin or traps even fires.I tried to light my fires to cook food but AO ! doesnt work and when underground i can see through walls and on the first day i got attacked by day ten monsters. FINALLY I GET A GOOD START! But 10 mins later NOCLIPPING PEOPLE!?!?!?!? They walked through my traps and when i sat in my log cabin they noclipped through that I get a solid 30 fps on arma 3 with full graphics and most the same but i put this on low and i get 3-7 fps i mean come on! This game needs improvement i do still play it and it can be enjoyable but until i see things change i will not like this.
No online multiplayer :(
good 8 hours of gaming if your a penny arcade fan
I love this game. This game really described sometimes how I feel, I have been battling depression for 3 years and I still have it ,but I am winning. I take medication and goto a therapist. Sometimes my horrors have been real, but I got through it and I don't care about the horrors anymore. I would like to thank whoever made this, my mum for supporting me, my dog for company and myself for getting over everything.
Fun game but one massive problem.Whenever  I go into a game, i get above and beyond 1500 ping!!!Thats completely unacceptable.
This game fascinated and intriqued me, to be honest. It was a nice, meditative, contemplative, unique experience. However, in my opinion, it's more of an "interactive work of art" then a game. That's the only way I can think of describing The Plan, an interactive work of art.The game didn't make me cry or anything like some other people have been saying (unless they are sarcastic), but it did make me think. When the game was finally over, all I could do was just simply sit there, looking at the screen, not making a sound, because I had no words to describe what I had just experienced. This has been a unique experience for me as a gamer, and I would recommend this to anyone who wants to try something a little bit different.
love this game
So, I made a short sentence saying this game was good. I loved it..... Robocraft.Removing tiers, adding megabots, buffing even more .... that shouldn't have in.What else do they have?... mechs and shields. Why though? Because idiots like all of us will think its cool because it looks flashy and awesome. It really isn't.They have DLC. On an early access game that was once good. Why?They even removed coloured blocks. And then you have to buy them.Please do not get this game.
Amazing game! It pulls on a lot of skills to make a successful heist. You need a good team, a team that communicates and a team that has experience.Play with friends and RP a little! Makes it heaps better!Worth every cent!
Get it lel 10/10
They Should Add A Story Mode For A New Counter Strike
Rubbish Game! Very hard to aim!
Slow and full of grindyness like a FTP MMO, and they are now introducing microtransactions.
This honestly is one of the worst games on steam, i hate it, the controls are all glitchy, it crashes a lot, can't believe i wasted $30 on this crap. want my money back
10/10 would waste my time again on games like this
Rockstar can go .... themselves. 14hours of troubleshooting. 2 years of waiting.
bad pc  and controler button set up. firing grenades and other item selection is clumsy lumped together extra
well, i think I've experienced all this game has to offer.thanks for wasting my money
this game is worth the money to buy it
Of all the Assassin's Creed  is the best.
PLease fix this i have no maps and no ae4 and it won't install
Love it
The best FPS of all times. A lot of DLC coming regularly. Kudos to valve !

to play this game you are going to need team work. you cannot possibly survive by yourself. + A really welldone zombie game
play this game, it is the most story intensive game i have played since to the moon, highly recommended.
I rate 8/8 
Os zumbis são rápidos e fortes, os humanos são lerdos e fracos, você morre em questão de segundos quando for carregar a arma...
This game is redonkulously hard. It's not fun just starting the game with the hill and your friends get shot straight away because they just wanted to charge an be heroes while they crawl to you afterwards wanting to get healed but instead I put them out of thier miseries with my pistol for 2 reasons is that I wanted to be greedy and as for the other it was to just teach them a lesson. I'd rather play cod.
Very great game! Love it so much. Once you start playing you'll never stop! :)
i  have download it and payed 22$ i was happy i gotit and as soon  as i open it erro crash 6-1-2016 was not happy until that is fix its a thubs down
Do not buy this game at this stage, buy Arma III or even Arma II, have fun enjoyin all the different game modes. Then at some point, and if, and that's a big IF: DayZ stand alone ends up being okay, then contemplate getting it if you have a spare $20-$30. If not sleep well knowing you have not wasted money on something that is almost a year late and about as fun as pissin glass.
awesome game remmand it very much because a very rich story line (mind you i love AC) but i do love french so a bit bad that they made the french the main bad guys becausew the spanish where more into slavery than the french where talking about 1700's but still very good game
Still holds up as a great FPS after a decade
yay the best experience! i think this is the cousin of Starmade!it can make you poop rainbows!
Best AI 2014
WARNING: If you own rayman legends do not purchase you can get all of the levels from this game in the next installment

An action-packed game that will certainly send chills through your spine at least once during the gameplay. If the main storyline wasn't horrifying enough for you, you can withness the events that happened prior to it in the Whistleblower DLC. The graphics in the game are excellent and the game is terrifying. However, the places to hide get repetitive as the game progresses because they look moreorless the same: lockers, under desks, etcetera.The encounters are filled with suspense and fear, although that fear becomes irritation and rage after a while. I believe this to be something that the game developers wanted. As time went by, you were just eager to leave the asylum and you began to play more recklessly and you felt like you knew the asylum, which is to your advantage. Overall, I think it's definitely worth playing because it was a very well built game. 9/10
Rush B --> Get Flashbanged --> Lose pistol Round --> Disconnect from game --> Watch WarOwl --> Play the game again(With some expectations) --> Lose the game "Sorry for bad english"
Fantastic  game
Planetside 2 is a fun game, if you don't have it you should get it but only if you computer fits the specs. I would recommnend this game to everyone!
Codemasters have done it again!, They are incapable of producing a bad racing game. 10/10 A+ 5 Stars, Loads of Fun.
Can't login game
Kingdoms Rise is without a doubt a game with a lot of potential but one that still needs a bit of work.The gameplay mechanics itself are pretty great, the idea of spells in the game are well done in some ways, and the map design is certainly interesting, encouraging players to learn the maps and think of certain strategies associated with those maps. And for being early in development the character customization is rather good, even if it could be better.However there are some bad things, the animations when it comes to attacks and such are rather boring, and don't have the same amount of 'feeling' in it compared to games like Chivarly (granted, Chivalry did have a bigger dev team and more funds). The lack of music in the game certainly doesn't help, not even a light ambience in the main menu, making the game feel rather dull honestly. Hitboxes feel off, and during online play people with only a 20 ping difference seem to have a large advantage of those with higher ping, making the hitbox issue even worse.Overall, I'd give this game a 6/10, the idea is great, it just needs to be refined a bit more.
When the game isn't crashing, it is stuttering worse than an autistic kid watching sonic. Also, instead of fixing said issues, they went full EA and added microtransactions.1/10, and only cos you can slide up stairs, do not buy.
YOU'RE A WINNER MAX! A WINNER!
I like the idea and I hope they help the gaming community to improve but as of right now I can't quit it so i can't play other games. I also can't uninstall it and it doesn't show up on my task manager. I restarted my computer but it is still running. Please make this work. Australia's horrible internet needs it.
great game with a group of mates
This game apparently has a charm that is lost on me.I didn't like the art styleI appreciated the combat/challenge aspect but i found it quickly became repetative.The story telling seemed good but the writers sense of humor wasnt for me.Unfortunatly after about an hour or so of play i didnt want to play any moreWell priced though
Tf2 is my girl but I once played a game in the ranking system learnt how to play as my team carried me. 10/10 people thought I was trolling when I actually had no idea.
Good
I love the tutorial, i raged when it said "Press G to use grenade"Then I said to my self "I EFFING KNEW IT"3/10 Best GameWhy Best Game? Cos my favourite part was when I uninstalled it
I've havent even go into the new game *crasheswell played uPlay
It a good game get it
Best free game I've ever played.
this game is not balanced enough. if you buy any sniper rifle its 100% win.
Boring, dry landscape and terrible graphics. I don't care if you can "fix that with mods" you get what you buy.
dont waste your time
This is a must play sandbox game. Even though its only the beta right now, its probably one of the best sandbox games i have ever played.
got to cook 3 bags of meth on first missionnuff said
... ...., a bug 5 minutes into the game which wouldn't let me continue, it told me to equip a bow and I did and didn't move forward, piece of .... game, developers need to fix their ........
Let me tell you about this game. It's not even about the game anymore. It's about how it starts:You're a cool guy. You've never watched anime, except for like, Dragonball or whatever. But that was cool, right? Then you get to high school and you think to yourself, man, all these ♥♥♥♥in weebs. what a bunch of total losers. You leave high school. You start watching anime on netflix because you've watched literally everything else on there. It dawns on you. You like it. You actually love anime. You feel the transformation. The hunger for superior Japanese content. Words you used to use as a joke, you now use in all seriousness. You start watching hentai. 
Don't Starve Together is one of my favourite survival games. It's got everything that singleplayer has and more! There's a lot of collectable items that change the way something looks or what they can do.For instance, you can wear a red T-shirt that only changes how you look, but you can also make a bottemless fire pit which will never need feul to run!In short, this game is different to the origional not only with multiplayer, but with many things that will change the situation entierly!
So I'm about 4 hours into this, haven't even really pushed much of the story and I have to say this game right here is the game that despite the combat system and it playing like a classic Final Fantasy game (might not be the best analogy I could use...don't judge me I come from the shooter and racing genre I didn't play a lot of game with wait your turn combat lol) but despite the play style it is and me hating wait your turn combat I love this game. I feel like I'm in an episode of South Park and it's just great all around.
This game is pretty cool.Nothing is specifically better than everything else like in skyrim.You can use hammers and be cool which is fun.Shimmering Isles dlc is one of the best dlc's I've had the pleasure of experiencing. 7/10
GOOD GAME
Fun game but very short story if u are a person that take quailty over quatanity take this game it is great
The previous Batman Games were absolutely amazing! Can't belive the amount you guys stuffed up these time. Dont understand why a game thats been made using a PC is so badly optimized FOR PC....
Worst game in history
hillariously fun and crazy! its a perfect shooter for any gamer
bane is way too op
The Long Dark is amazing. I can play it for hours, just zoned out and immersed in the harsh world. It is quite difficult to find a good game in the post-apocalyptic survival genre which does not contain zombies, and The Long Dark nails it.
In 2009 the world witnessed Batman: Arkham Asylum. Before Arkham Asylum was released, the gaming world was still in question about why another comic book game was going to be released, especially as they were all such a letdown. Batman is a widely known hero and making a game about him and his legacy is not easy. Well it turns out that Rocksteady knew their stuff and Arkham Asylum was hailed as the BEST comic book game of all time. How could a sequel possibly be better than Arkham Asylum? Fast forward to 2011, the highly anticipated release of Arkham City. Does it live up to the hype?To put it simply, it does. Batman: Arkham City is a perfect example of how passion and knowledge of the core content can create a terrific piece of gaming. Arkham City, has shifted setting from the moody Asylum into the gritty Arkham City. Once again, the world created by Rocksteady here is immersive, huge and looks beautiful. Arkham City is full of things to see and do from the 15 or so lengthy side missions and the 400+ Riddler objectives to complete. The side missions here are fleshed out and are extremely varied, which ultimately creates interesting stories about the various characters which the player encounters through Batman’s time within Arkham City. Completing these side objectives are given meaning through the different decisions that Batman must take/decide, which results in meaningful story and character development. The Riddler trophies this time around are more plentiful and come with tougher puzzles than before. These pesky trophies are addictive to collect and have been hidden in the least expected places. Obtaining these trophies feels rewarding and satisfying as you’re one step closer to shutting down the Riddler’s operation. After collecting a certain number of these trophies, a mission to save a hostage appears on the map, and these missions are a welcome addition to the content that Rocksteady has already provided. Trophies aren’t the only thing related to the Riddler however. Riddler’s Revenge combat, predator and campaign maps are back, but are given more thought and is fleshed out with much more content than Arkham Asylum. The freeflow combat is amazing as it was in Arkham Asylum. Combos, takedowns, throws, etc. are back and it feels extremely smooth. The new gadgets that are obtained through the story mode and other side content add to Batman’s arsenal found in Arkham Asylum, and can be freely used in all combat sequences, not just the Riddler Revenge maps. This signifies the amount of freedom and player choice that Rocksteady has given to the player by giving them the option to progress through the game anyway they desire. Story wise, Batman: Arkham City is well written and intricately designed. Characters evoke emotion and are introduced in meaningful ways, and the way these characters are introduced doesn’t feel rushed. Story missions are also well executed by slowly increasing in difficulty through each combat and predator encounter, resembling smooth flow between missions so as not to feel repetitive. Boss fights are better than Arkham Asylum and require more thought. The story is also quite lengthy. Expect to invest at least 12 hours just to complete the games storyline.Game of the Year edition is basically the base game released in 2011 but with the inclusion of all character packs and story DLC, Harley Quinn’s Revenge. Being able to play as Catwoman, Robin and Nightwing feels refreshing. It is evident that Rocksteady has put in their knowledge and passion of Batman history through these characters as they all possess different combat moves, which then requires different tactics and experimentation from the player. Rocksteady has employed a wise tactic by giving the player the choice to play as their “favourite character”, meaning that more hours can easily be invested into the game, as to master these new characters. Although being able to play as these characters is a nice break from playing as Batman, it would have been nice to play as these characters in the world instead of restricting them to just the challenge maps. The Harley DLC is also quite a nice inclusion as it adds to the already lengthy game time. The story isn’t as deep as Arkham City, but it is an enjoyable ride getting through Harley’s goons for 3 or 4 hours.The only downside to the game are that some of the early characters introduced in the game are underused or never even seen as the story progresses. This is a shame, especially for a game of such caliber that these iconic characters would miss out on their opportunity. At least these characters could be used more in a side mission or be seen later on through an Easter egg, in which the game has many.Not addressing everything the game does well, the smooth freeflow combat, intense predator stealth sequences, well written and engaging storyline, immersive open world, plentiful side missions along with the plethora of collectibles and Easter eggs make Batman: Arkham City a long lasting and near perfect game that actually makes the player feel like the Bat. Expect to throw away at least 50 hours of your life as you experience what this awesome game has to offer.9.8/10
FEELS THE SAME as the first one
Como puede ser que compre el juego por 15.99 Dolares y no me funcione!! Ni bien lo abro me sale el logo de valve y se crashea asi, en muchos foros de Steam muchos comentan lo mismo por favor arreglen eso
Yes this is very fun there are nokill rp servers aswell but if your crazy than kill some mofos on rex rampage!Rex rampage is full of dino killers! you can even be the dinosaurs!!your option of teams re dinosurs or humans i really recommend this game if you buy it you wil see! =)
Why So Evil is a puzzle game that claims to be very, very, very hard. In this game there are no checkpoints, no saving, and no fun. The controls aren't the worst but can be blisteringly frustrating on some levels. The aim is to navigate a cube thing through fifty uninventive levels to get to the other cube thing. Some levels have some pretty cool ideas. but most are just really frustrating, or really dumb. This game is alright for the dirt sale price, but otherwise stay the hell away. After half an hour of playing this, the uninstall was well worth it.
Gratuito, só que não... ;-;
I just wish people wouldn't do this asset flip stuff. Rest in peace originality.There's actually potential for a decent game here, if the gamemodes were a bit more varied rather than all the same thing, and the assets didn't cost $29.50 it could actually be a calming, fun flight sim. But alas, every gamemode is the same and the game was designed by somebody else...
this games so sick it crashes when you try to play it despite it being made on  a sprite machine
LOLOLOLOLOL.This game is shutting down guys. They closed the Australian Server so now I can't play without lag. Spent real money on it just to be let down....
This game has possibly the BEST storyline I have come across in ages!!! I still have no idea what happened!!!
pointless.
At first I was skeptical..... but damn... much better than I expected.
when i get out of the game it says i am still in it
Finished the game without getting a single achievement.Swell/10.
i love this game
Team fortress 2 is a awesome fps with 9 classes and tradeing and muiltplayer and new updates and the store with a price of 0.00$ this is a game worth playing
Many will call it the wet dream of a wallet warrior, and I can certanly see their point.But this game is fun and has a fresh concept. This makes worth a try and the best part is...ITS FREE.
This game was really good before they change the layout and how it looks, now it just looks like ...., when I go into a game I cant hear anything beside some ..... talking and then they had to .... it up
I can't say that this is a good game at all, unfortunately. While the art is charming in its own way, and the music may be to your liking... that's about all this game has going for it. Not quite sure if the music really fits the game either, but to each their own. The gameplay is uninspiring, to be honest - there are much better Bullet Hell and Shoot 'Em Up games around. The weapons, abilities, and enemies are all extremely limited.The Main Menu should be pretty important to a game, right? Well, I've had issues with it locking up, and it's all just a mess - it's far harder to navigate and use than it has any right to. This is compounded by the Options - not even the ability to turn off the music and sound effects? Pretty poor...The value, or the lack thereof, of the Trading Cards (1 gem or 4 cents at the time of writing) mean that even Trading Cards don't really make the game worthwhile.
I'd say this is an extremely well done visual novel and well worth the price. Besides some translation issues (which they are working on) the game is pretty much flawless in my opinion.I finished my first playthrough at ~5 hours and I'm fairly certain I got one of the worst, if not the most depressing ending.  The dude became mental and lived the rest of his life by himself  But, that's all the more reason to keep playing right?
This game is ...., all you do is watch a Mountain Grow!
I played this a year ago and it was dead then, apparently its still dead
Its a waste of ... money its like a ...... weeb monoply actualy lost halve my brain cells playing this game
"input not supported error" can't get it to run in at 1080, and now can't change the resolution to anything that works. have tried -safe and -autoconfig and -w #
why i can't play.
As others have said far more articulately, with this Season of The Walking Dead your choices don't matter, the characters aren't memorable, the story is depressing to a fault, and the whole thing peaks early at the climax of Chapter 3.
muitplayer shut down
Would chase chickens again whilst listening to the Benny Hill Theme.10/10
This game is so cancerous, I would pay good money to have it removed from my account.
This game is an interesting piece of... something. I would say that it's a bad game, mostly because it's trying to be a horror game and it isn't, it's extremely overpriced, the graphics range from okay to eye-bleedingly bad, has way too many bugs and the story is extremely hard to follow. BUT. Even though it really doesn't feel like a Resident Evil game, I'd hate to say it, but the co-op is sort of fun. I love how the game gives players different tasks and makes them get seperated and cover eachother. It just feels... interesting. Also, killing ememies is incredibly satisfying. Some of the boss battles are sort of cool, like the one on the second chapter of Chris 'n' Piers' campaign. Also, if you play it with a friend, laughing at the many broken things you find is awesome. So... I give this game a recommendation.
Didn't like it!
used to be goodthen got pretty popularnow its toxic af and i cant stand it
Really good zombie game for a free game
My H1Z1 Story~Destiny purchases H1Z1 ~ Don't buy this game until the full release. I'm saving you $20~Downloads game~Launches~Creates a simple account *Thank you*~Updates~Launches~Crashes G99 error~Launches again~Crashes99/10 would write a bad review for this game again
The community is ..... Its difficult to set up a server. But other than that the game play is fine.I'll give it a rating of 4 out of 10 potatoes
Let me put it this way...The Lego Jurassic World game version is much, much better than this corny piece of crap. As a hardcore fan of the novels and movies, I feel Telltale have horribly ruined the concept of Jurassic Park. I cringed the entire way through this very long cartoon. So disappointed in this game.--> The graphics is like I said, a cartoon.--> The animation is really bad. I mean REALLY bad. It's still VERY glitchy.--> The dinosaurs are portrayed as unrealistically stupid and slow. This goes especially for the raptors and T-rex.--> The writing behind this game is a joke.--> Quick Time Events are the devil. This type of gameplay forces you to become disengaged from the story since you are constantly on edge in case you miss a button press. (If they show, still buggy)The game is basically a cartoon to watch. There's no control. It's entirely QTE. You might as well watch this on YouTube.To save youself some money, watch the game here. It's pretty much the same thing:
Intense FPS with great looking characters,weapons,hats and etc.
....ING STUPID GAME IF YOU DON'T get deranked after one game by losing if i could get a refund i would get gnm should be atleast mg 2 now and instead i got deranked by one game each time no matter how many ... wins i had gn2 now so unless they adapt a real proper and fair way of ranking this maybe i wouldn't have quit this is pure
This game....let you play like you want,custom most of things,update almost every week,is so fun,is fair to play against equals since the stock wep are not underpowered and well that is all.
Absolutely incredible and interesting new approach on zombie survival, and to top it off it was all done by one young individual! Great fun, well worth the 5 dollar upgrade as well.
its pretty lame when you play it for a full 2 months straight.
Have you ever asked yourself "Should I blow up that cat over the road with little rats dressed up as terrorists?"If no dont get this game.If yes see a doctor
Not happy jan
This is a very good game because of the graphics and gamplay but it would be better if it had multiplayer.
... sucks
I really wasn't sure about buying this game, but I did , and I'm glad to say it wasn't a disapointment . I'm using a mouse and keyboard and haven;t had any problems , you must like stalth to enjoy the  game . I read that the graphics wasn't particularly good , but in fact they are fine, there'splenty of climbing and alternative routes to explore and always endless guards to get past. As you progress into the game you earn skill points which are used to up grade Styx making the character less vunerable and able to do some interesting things ....like clone himself. I think there could be a bright future for this chacter .especially if they made him more of a warrior (perhaps) . For the price it's good value.
This entire game can get well and truly .... It's like a two year old tried to recreate battlefield with some legos and a clump of their own .....
stoped upodating and is boring
+many unique playable char.+deflect bullet with your sword.+massive, over used explosive. +destructible map level.+lotsa enemy to kill.+co op. =no char selection on start mission. you got random?=2 way aim, either you aim to left side or right side. =need fast reflect XD reflex.. replex...re..re (skip) to stay alive longer. tho you can play it at slower pace by doing gorilla tac... oh well...whatever-player dead in 1 hit, actually I'm ok with that, but the random char is annoy me :C dah pw matek pisan, piye to bro XD-player forced to change char when trying to get more life. this should be optional? -a stupid playmate that can destroy a whole map by throwing rambro grenade all over the place and shot like a mindless zombie.Time-killer. cool gameplay on video that I watched. but after defeating the big alien, I got bored....
When i set my graphics options to high, my world started melting, not a fun experience
It the awesome.
after enjoying this game for 600hours i've been noticing the rise in smurfs and hackers.met 1 today which showed absolutely no respect for anyone one the server calling us noobs and showing no professionalism and met a wall hacker and the other team didnt want to kick him off the server and called me noob
unlocking planes used to be nice but now have to play in order to get one
Wow, Cities: Skylines... Where to begin...- Firstly, this game is the game that EA's Simcity should have been, except about 1000 times better. More buildings, more options, better gameplay mechanics and generally more everything!- Secondly, The gameplay and the customisation feature of this game are truely its strong point. With thousands of Workshop items, assets and vechicles created by a community of dedicated fans that are added to your game with a simple click. This adds a whole new level to a game which no other rival city builder can truely compare to. Did I mention that these Workshop add-ons are FREE???- Thirdly, The Developers ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT THE GAME. That is one thing that EA missed on with Simcity, EA just rode the current of their popularity river that the Sim series has created and as soon as the game was released, the game was mostly left to cough, splutter and die due to its lack of new features, AI problems and repetitiveness. Simcity did see a few updates but nothing compared to the love this game has recieved from the developers.
This is a very great game and i think the fun of this game is never going to end as they add more stuff more fun comes in place but if you want the full experience of this game you will need Counter strike:Source and other games that have stuff in it like Team Fortress 2 and CSS (Counter strike:Source) is mainly the only other thing you need but other wise the game is great
Want to waste your money? BUY THIS! could not think of a single positive thing to say about this game in its current state.(jan2014)
was great when i could play it now i  just want my money back
Other than forcing me to write this review to unlock a character it's a good game!
This game is... disturbing. Just getting it out now. However, this game will keep you hooked for many hours. It's quite challenging, but don't let dying over and over throw you off. This game is quite rougelike, with the randomly generated floors. The powerups vary from a laser that replaces your main projectile, your own tears, to using your own urine as a weapon (which is one of the worst items in the game). The game is great, but if you aren't sure about the game being on Flash, maybe you should wait for the remake. This game is one of the best games i've played in years, and at $5 it's an absolute bargain.
Great story and combat, only problems are the fps drops and tank battles
In the short time that I've played the game there are two things that have jumped out at me.The first is that the game has very fun, fast gameplay. The game definitely rewards skill and with great precision you can kill even the highest levelled players. The combat can be frustrating when you get completely stunlocked by another player, which is especially frustrating for a new player who does not understand the game yet and is attempting to learn the mechanics. In terms of the gameplay, this game is very good.The second thing that I have noticed is that this game is EXTREMELY unbalanced. Although the game claims that it will match you with players of "equal level and skill", it is lying to you. At level 1, you will get matched with level 20 players that have full sets of gear and will tear you apart. This makes learning the basics of the game very difficult. It also makes the game somewhat unfair. They definitely need to fix the matchmaking in this game ASAP. It deters new players (like myself) almost immediately from wanting to play the game any further. The gameplay is great and so is the game itself, but this level of unbalance and the feeling of it being unfair from the very beginning has made me turn my decision and not recommend this game for the moment. The learning curve is too great for you to be thrown into a game full of high level players.I hope that this gets changed soon, I see real potential in this game.
This game is difficult to control but that just makes for so many hilarious moments
:D
The trailer was great, the actual short movie is pretty average (almost want to call it lame). I had much higher expectations from it in terms of story and acting.
It's good, it's like smash and i beat up my friends girlfriend8/10 stars but would be 10/10 if koji and hattori were the only characters
This game has the potential for something even bigger! Thisgame is AMAZING butrequires too many hours of play time to progress,, and that that is the only downside to this game, otherwise this game is amazing!
fun game, lots of mod, played this game on my old computer since i was 12. 9/10
Game works in a similar way to Adventure Capitalist and Cookie Clicker. Get the game if you enjoy clicking. Thats the only reason why i got this game.
i find it an ok game has couple bugs but other then that i  am finding it good i bought some diamonds  to help
good tactical game
Really good game, one of those games that is simple yet at the same time surprisingly fun and addictive. It has a short story which is easy to complete if you know how, but one bad game can make or break your company.
If you want to play a Star Trek Space game try something like Bridge Commander. This is pretty much a pay to win space game losely based on Star trek
The game lags like hell on hardware that surpasses your minimum specs listed. The game throws you into the action without telling you what the heck is going on. One tip... DONT SPAWN PLAYERS RIGHT NEXT TO ENEMIES WHEN THEY BOOT THE GAME UP.
Extreme Lack of updates, cars sound the same, smaller cars get run off the track too easily, AI is stupid, poor customisation (currently), very annoying theme song. Just a lack of content in general. There's only so much figure-8 derbys you can do with a car you can't even upgrade. This game has been in early access for YEARS.Nice damage model though.
It is a good game. If u play it every day of ur life. If u dont all ur building will decay and u will have nothing. 4/10
i cant even play the god damn game, as soon as i try to log in it already has my old email set up, i cant even access that so i have no idea as to what is going on
Now that I've finally finished the Walking Dead series, the invisible onion cutting people have left :*(
A poor example of a puzzle solving game. There's no real thinking required, just trial and error pointing and clicking. That said, it does have its humourous moments and I guess I got 99 cents worth of chuckles.
If you're getting this game for the story, you should. If you're getting it for the gameplay, don't. The story of wolfenstein is decent. My advice would be to wait until this game is on sale for less than $10 to buy it. 6/10
Yep thats it
Great game,too bad the developer give up on this.
NOT RECCOMMENDED!I bought this game thinking it would be great because i like these type of games but it doesnt work! My computer can run it but it just constantly crashes when i try to load it up or it would take forever to load and just stay on a certain percent. If they can fix this i will buy it again if it is worth it when they fix this problem. Until then, it is not worth it.....
I do not recommend this as the game is extremely simple. There is no challenge, no scares. The AI is woefully terrible, which I guess could be forgiven as they are zombies, however it just feels too easy on hard. I only played the first few levels, but the feel of the game just felt wrong. Like an unfinished game. There needs to be more fun rather than an endless stabbing zombies in the head simulator.If you are a fan of the series and want a Walking Dead experience then I would highly recommend you go and purchase the Telltale games series of The Walking Dead. They are brilliant pieces of storytelling that make you emote, and feel like you are actually making decisions that change the story. However if you wish for a FPS zombie shooting game then you should play something like the COD:Black Ops 1/2 Zombie mode.
Epic game! and......ITS FREE!!!!
It does not launch, and i recomend getting episodes from librity city
Worst purchase on Steam so far. I got tricked into buying this mediocrity by over-hyped gaming media and I regret every second of owning it. Unfortunately it happened way before steam introduced refund system, so this product will forever sit in my steam library as a silent reminder of why I lost trust in games sites.
game was great untill you made it ptw
this game is very good apart from some servers being abit laggy and sometimes takes a while to load but apart from that it is a good game. very fun
15 hours in and this game is jammin. I wanted something like FTL where I would lose the game many times before adjusting to the learning curve but so far Darkest Dungeon has proven to be much more manageable. Anyone who likes Lovecraftian lore with rogue like elements will enjoy.
Good Game Try to play this game
This game is a great and fun experience to play especially with some friends when you dont say who or what you are.Some of the pros can be things like replayability, good people, balanced gameplay. But you probably read all of this before. 
Smite is an amazing game and the concept is absolutely perfect. This game would also be perfect if.... HiRezStuidos pulled their .... together and instead of marketing, they decided to fix the numerous issues they already have. For example.The Accept button for games, that has been broken for about 6 months, will they ever fix it? (To answer the question you must also answer, will they get money for doing it, if no, then you have no chance in hell for that being fixed.)Balancing gods. This has always been an issue in Smite with some gods being so useless they are never seen, while other gods are so overpowered that they are the winning factor of games. Once again, if HiRez fixes it, will they get money? Probably not? Okay then, it's not being fixed.Servers causing people to randomly crash. This has been somewhat fixed but is still an issue, but HiRez has probably ignored the issue now since they did little work to fix it.  Once more we go with the rule. (Will it make HiRez money? "no" Then HiRez shall not fix it.)This game has the potential to be the greatest Moba, but HiRez Studios is dragging it down constantly by not caring about the actual gameplay and only caring about money.I absolutely adore this game, but at this state, I cannot reccomend  it.
as chris smoove once said "2k did me dirty there"yep.... servers are down, gameplay is laggy, you dont get your pre order bonus, you cannot configure your keyboard controls, 2k wants you to spread your hand muscle till it hurts to plau this game and maybe you should just stop wasting money on this franchise which gets worse every single yearGOOD ....ING JOB 2K
Great visual novel. Pros:- Great choices and consequences- Variety of situations- Brilliant writing, develops characters in a very short time to great effect- Some good roleplay optionsCons- Soundtrack can get tediousOverall, a great game that is definitely worth your time (very less time, that is).9/10
When they say  "The most fun you can have online" they were so utterly right
Absolutely and utterly terrible game. when you and a million people cannot even get to the main menu, you know the game is done pretty damn badly. guess bohemian are still playing with barbies and havent decided to acctually get a real job and create a properly functioning videogame.
best fps game
This game is Flat out too complicated! I dont even get a Crosshair!! too many controles, too much sniping and blurry lensflare graphical vomit. I am Utterly disapointed. Day of Defeat is Better than this By FAR
HACKERS HACKERS HACKERS DEVS ARNT DOING ....!
Pay to win.
Play only with your friends. The community is suck.
- -*
THis shouldn't even be free it's so cool but yeah I like it SO MUCH!
To Many updates its everyday
this game is terrible full of hackers bad graphics and not worth your time DO NOT DOWNLOAD
this game is a good open world adventure with a lot of items and a lot of monsters and NCP's that live in houses in vilages or in castles on hills with dozens of guards to protect the lords
Pros:* Tolkien universe* Interesting premise* Orcs fall into simple categories - Normal, Urak, Archers, Spear Throwers, Hoplites, Captains, WarchiefsCons:* Orcs are pertually respawning to the point where you feel you make no progress* You don't ever feel like you are making progress* If you ever do make progress, that is short lived and replaced with more orcs* All of the orcs seem to be chav's converted by the dark lord* I would have enjoyed watching this more as a movie than playing it as a game* It's essentially a re-skinned, re-mapped batman arkham city* Had to double check to see if ubisoft made it
I quite like Rust but it's definetly not perfect, Rust is basically DayZ, Minecraft and garry's mod combined into one game, for the most part it's pretty good but Rust is a bit Rusty at it's early stages (see what I did there) because as most of you know, Rust is still in early access which means developers are still working on the game and there's quite a lot of bugs (seriously there is) and it's the simple things like not getting into a server and not being able to craft items and other bugs and glitches that are really annoying, as it stands now, it's a solid game but I wanna see what happens for Rust in the future 20 bucks I think is a bit steep for what it is at the moment, but if you wanna give this game I try I say go ahead it gets an 8/10 rock holding cave men
The Pay2Win level of this game is just........ It can be played casually and without investing any money in it but then you would be at a huge disadvantage due to the fact that you have weapons that barely match theirs.I honestly tried to get to the max level....... But every time they updated the level cap would just increase, and the fact that you  rank up too slowly without the exp multiplier that the Premium players get just forced me to play this game for hours on end.I eventually stopped at rank 100+ The max rank is probably 235+ by now.The game's matchmaking system is purely unbalanced. If you're a bronze threat player....You basically get treated like dirt and get matched up against goldies, and also.... The backup that you get usually doesn't match the power that the opposition has, unless of course you roll with a clan that's filled with 150+ ranked silvers and goldies.But then again, there are some actually decent people that actually have skill in playing this, it's just a bit sad that the community is just......... But still, I would recommend it with friends, and also don't take this game too seriously
A great game, tonnes of fun to play with a friend or two. The AI are actually decent on any setting and the maos are all brilliant. Combat mechanics are perfect, the learning curve is quite gentle, and the game has great replayablilty. One of my favorite strategy games ever.
Optimization this game after few last updates is one big joke. FPS suddenly drops from 110-120 to 20-30 without reason. Low setting didn't changed anything. Waste of time.
I loved the 2nd Serious Sam but this really didnt do it for me.
That voice acting is... Annoying.0/10, needs better voice acting
Yeah CS was good, But it was ruined....... By Constant Smurfs and derankers. Just played an MGE game where a Silver Elite Went 46-5. this game has turned to ....
This game starts off really well, as the transition from the old 8-bit era to the 3D part is pretty cool. But this transition happens in a space of half an hour and the game turns for the worse after the game becomes 3D. After that it becomes a bad zelda and final fantasy clone.The turn-based strategy is way too easy, as your partner has a heal spell that is effective considering how little damage the enemies do. She doesn't do a whole lot of damage (except for x-crystal, but the hero can do just as well.), there is no limit on how many times you can use her spell and it heals both characters. At the moments when she isn't around, you have enough money to buy a bunch of potions to last you until your partner comes back. Because of this, the battles will get boring and mind-numming very quickly and you'll start running from battles just to get past them.The action-adventure gameplay isn't as bad, as some of the levels have intresting mechanics like shifting back and forth from 16-bit to 3D but these sections don't last as long and they don't get repeated. They should've stuck with these ideas as it could've added more puzzles and ways to get around them. Instead it focuses more on the combat, which is stiff to say the least.Overall, it takes a lot of ideas, some from other games and some entirely unique, and sticks it all together instead of getting a few ideas and expanding upon thoses to make the game feel like an exploration through the action/adventure genre rather than a game that took ideas from other games in hope of it working well. Combined the fact that the game is really short and that it's $10, this game isn't worth getting.
This game was fun and all when I first started, I was also reaaally baad.But then, after a couple of days I started getting better.So good infact that a buch of ....... squeakers got so butthurt they reported me, ALL OF THEM.Now my account is "Globally Untrusted" and on cooldown.So if you're the really competitive type, do not get this game.You cannot be better than anyone.
This game WILL reset your characters! Just had all mine returned back to LEVEL F*CKING ONE, I had two level 15 survivors and a level 10 killer. Now nothing. F*ck you guys, seriously.
The game that made me get bad grades at school :D
"You "earn" money. You spend money. Is ironic paradox, yadda yadda."
Do not get it!
10/10 Would not buy again-Gamespot
So good.
Amazing game, love it
Should be finishing my uni degree anytime now
**BUY THIS BEFORE #2, no question** [While 400 Days DLC is not essential, imo, it is a fun addition.]Read all the books?  Going crazy waiting for the next episode?  Play the games.  The Walking Dead is a great story game for fans of the comic book series and show to satisfy their withdrawals.   Using the "Chose your own adventure" format, this game allows you to make decisions effecting your survival and directing where the story goes.  While Glenn and Herschel appear early in the game, all other characters and plot twists are original.If you are looking to fight zombie and shoot things, this is not for you. Keep in mind though, while the focus of this game is an immersive story line, stay on your toes or you will end up dead!
Really?The game was originally made in Japan, all of the voices in the game are Japanese, and yet I can't play the game in Japanese?Screw you too.
yes i do recommend but what really people wants in this game is the old version of rust with a good VAC
butifel
Fight over chester with your friends - 10/10
I didn't expect to like this game as much as I did. Very fun and challenging, lots of hours to delve into and many different side stories.
A bit of fun but could argue jusat sort of CS:GO with fancy high tech equipment. Overall pretty good doe
It's a decent mod, it has a good community that makes great content. The only problem I have with it is calling it a game. Garry's Mod is a mod of Valve's Half-Life 2. Garry Newman, the man behind the mod, decided to make a map, put some tools in, copy and paste content from the Half-Life 2 folder and call it a game. I remember when this game was 20.00$ back when it looked interesting enough to check out, but with only being a kid with no money, and having a father who doesn't trust buying things on the internet, I was out of luck, so about 2 years later when I had my own card to buy the game with, it felt like the first time kissing a girl, amazing. After everything was all set, actually playing the game, and figureing out how to play was a pain in the as*s. Then, with a website full of content that other people made, and not knowing how to install said downloaded content, was all the more frustrating. Then the big 13 update came along with the workshop so the communnity could hold the mod's hand the whole time, just one problem, the whole game changed so nothing that I learned sinked, all the new features made no sense to a normal player such as my self. To sum it all up, if you want to play this game and have any actual fun, you have to Have no life and learn how to use every feature in the game. If you want to play Multiplayer you have the pleasure of being ..... by doushbag admins, along with having to tollerate ear shattering sounds of little kids crying in the process, while your bing anally destroyed, as the old saying goes, the only winning move is not to play. The only reason to get this mod is to mess around with the Team Fortress 2 stuff, that's why I have it. If you don't have it, and your deciding to buy it or not, if someone tells you that it's something worth trying out, the person your talking to is not your friend, it's probably someone who has Garry's di*ck 1.54 inches in their as*s, probably Milfof6D9. Take it from someone with a life, job, and on the search for games worth playing on Steam, this mod is not worth the time.
Otimo game ;)
Couching makes you aim way bette awesome game to p|ay
A few years later and I still want my money back...In all honesty, its alright I guess, though the story is a bit jumpy at times and not as satisfying as the others with mediocre multiplayer games. If you really like COD then you should avoid it and spend your time playing other ones instead, well whatever.
Thoroughly enjoyed Goat Simulator 2014. Goat/10.Goat Simulator 2014 gives an in-depth experience that uses a wide range of engaging stimulus and challenges to educate us humans of the agricultural environment that a goat must endure through it's life. The inspiring story of Goat overcoming his/her oppressors (the humans) creates an amazing storyline, with numerous plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat. This game forces you to think. I love it.
was a good game until it started crashing and not allowing me to log on after exiting once
Gunslingers itself is fun,I enjoyed it when the matchmaking system actually gave us even geared teammates and opponents (which may explain why we only won two matches) But the micro transactions are too prevalent to ignore. Would I recommend this game to my friends currently, maybe depending on whether they can deal with the micro transactions, would I recommend this game if the micro transactions were removed or even balanced? Absolutely. Hopefully with this game being in early access, they will respond to the community’s gripes with them and remove them, because this game has potential to be good, real good. Check out the full review at 
If you want a casual moba on steam, play Strife.
Question: Is it possible to unlock things like the R&D Lab when you've already finished game?
...... Game. Not worth any price. Pirate it if you really have to play it...but its not worth it, no matter what the price. (Not even worth $1). Played better games that were free such as "How do you do it". Story and Gameplay is average but gets SUPER repetitive (Like alot)
By far one of the best ww2 strategy games availible 8/10
just crap
This game is really fun and you need the skill to play this game, I am bad, but it is fun9/10 awesome shooter and you MUST own this game if anyone sees this.
this game is fun this is like left 4 dead but alien and top view
The houes blew up within 10 seconds of me opening this game....don't bue it unless you like being homeless
I played this game a long time ago when it was good. Now it's not good. Nuff said, uninstall.
this WAS a good game. At launch it was unfinished and lacked weapons that had become standard in video games, to fix this issue overkill put out DLC containing these weapons however instead of realiseing it for free people had to pay 5 dollars for things like grenades and snipers. The game has also done way to much DLC. Don't get me wrong everyone likes good DLC however most of the DLC is horible and ruins the feel of the game like honestly why whould a bank robber use a bow and arrow or ninja stars?
rocketed myself by tying myself into a rocket into outerspace 10/10 would rocket again
-Played the demo on PSN before it's release, liked it.-Played the game when it was released on PS3 in 2008, loved it.-Played the game again on PC in 2015, still love it.Remains one of the most enjoyable games I've ever played.Surprisingly great port by SEGA, no issues at all.
Great game, .... microtransactions.(Although we all know microtransactions are ..... No need for me to add a redundant adjective there, but I did.)
